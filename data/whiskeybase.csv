Laphroaig 1967 RWD,96.2,45,"['Extremely complex and unique - in particular the nose - usually I would not be reluctant to rate the maximum but if I could choose between this one and the Springbank 100proof Samaroli I would prefer the Springbank profile - anyhow, this is for sure brilliant!\nNose\n100\n100\nFirst thing that comes into my mind is custard cream and egg liqueur, lot of toffee, wet tobacco, meaty, little beefstock, bacon, chocolate, marzipan, condensed milk, very shy smoke, woody hints, little spices, xmas spice, cloves, some dried fruits, plums, little demerara sugar, little nutty, whiffs of leather, almond oil - the complexity never ends - amazing!\nTaste\n99\n99\nPunchy, oily, creamy, little liquorice, subtle sweetness, little nutty, finest Havana cigar tobacco, more meaty notes, chocolate, coffee, bitter oranges, spices, herbs, dried fruits, sherry and woody notes, little peaty and smoky - fantastic!\nFinish\n99\n99\nLong, warm, spicy, little herbal, chocolaty, more tobacco, dried fruits, meaty - neverending - delicious!', ""From WhiskyFun Serge Valentin :\n\nLaphroaig 15 yo 1967/1982 (57%, Duthie's for Samaroli, sherry)\n\nColour: Mahogany. Nose: The most astonishing combination of medical tinctures, old hardwood shavings, myriad dark, stewed and tropical fruits and rich seam of wet earth, hessian, crushed walnuts, aged tar liqueur and pomegranate syrup. A totally and utterly spellbinding aroma at first nosing. Background aromas of still-warm coal hearths, aged stout and a saline inflected dunnage note with damp sack cloth and hessian. Quite bewilderingly complex, the kind of nose you can - and should - lose yourself in utterly for hours. With a little more time develops some more precise notes of green fruits, grapefruit and ripe blood orange. There really are just all kinds of aromas: myriad spices; dark chocolate; ancient balsamico - and of course I haven't even mentioned the peat yet.\n\nPure, brilliant, earthy, fat, almost visceral peat. The earthy quality almost goes into aged Pinot Noir territory. It's a hard to fathom the complexity of this nose. Wrapped around everything is the most pristinely earthy, farmy and enveloping sherry. With Water: More tar, more salt, more roof pitch, more flints, more distillate character! The green fruits and the tropical fruits really go to war now in the most spectacular fashion. In the end the tropical side wins - deft notes of passionfruit, pineapple and guava all mingle together. Seashore, warm brown bread, iodine and various medical tinctures. Endless... Mouth: The most intense, jelly-like density of syrupy, perfectly balanced sherry, dynamic peat, coal, earth, farmyard and a litany of tropical fruit. Astonishing whisky! Utterly, utterly majestic. The sherry and the peat are perfectly integrated and you have this kind of poised, focused dryness about the whole thing. Engine oil and seaweed and tar and rope all mingle. Tropical fruits still rolling around between everything. The palate feels more distillate driven than the nose which felt more dominated by the cask. The overall effect though is a perfect union of the two which comes across as even greater than the sum of its parts. With water: Not sure how it's possible but the whisky has become bigger, fatter and broader. A total masterpiece. A canvas of broad strokes and infinitesimal detail in between. Kippery, smouldering beach wood, mineral aspects, some citrus emerges, more coal hearths, tea tree oil, peat oils, more tar, more hessian, more dark, unctuous sherry fruit. More of everything! Finish: A vast spectrum of oily peat extracts, ancient sherry, rancio, various fruits and pitch black coffee. The darkest chocolate, simmering phenols, a whole NHS of medicines. A nervous, lithe, shimmering dance of flavours on slow fade. Comments: some whiskies, for all sorts of reasons, are powerfully moving but perhaps not as spellbinding on a technical level, which can give you pause for thought when trying to sum them up in a tasting note with a score attached. This, however, is one of those hyper-rarities where the technical brilliance and emotional intensity are so perfectly synchronised that it leaves no space in your mind for doubt. You cannot come away from this with any impression other than that you just tasted one of the greatest whiskies ever committed to glass. There is a melancholy about this whisky given that it is increasingly unlikely the dwindling number of bottles that remain will be opened. Indeed, the prices these fetch now make them more the stuff of wealth signalling and not really about whisky enthusiasm or culture anymore. All I can say is, I am glad to have been able to taste it."", 'Chocolate, dark fruits, medicinal peat, orange peel, black pepper, cedar wood, tobacco, espresso, Demerara sugar, polish, oak perfect integration of sherry peat. The finish lasts forever and is extremely complex with dark fruits developing into some tropical notes entangled with more of these superb phenolic notes. Perfect whisky but bowmore bouquet remains my best whisky ever.', ""In over 14 years of tasting and collecting whisky, this remains the absolute best liquid I have ever imbibed. A full 8 hours was spent nosing and tasting a small sample throughout the day and evening. Tasting notes would be a disservice, it must be experienced. It's the pure essence of tropical fruity, peaty, smoky, meaty Laphroaig in a perfect marriage with rich, viscous sherry. It's only one point shy of a perfect score as I have yet to try the Port Ellen Queen's visitation and Bowmore '66 Bouquet and want to leave some wiggle room in case those can be tasted someday.\n\nThis Laphroaig truly tastes like a master at the peak of their craft.

Strathisla 1967 RWD,95.9,23,"['Crazy class. Quite simply.\nWe cannot remain indifferent here. There is definitely something ""more"", which makes you dream.\nPerfect from start to finish.

I\'m starting to wonder why the average score is so high and if the “Samaroli” dream is really objective.\nThen I wait, I wait 45 minutes, I come back to this nose and it clicks. Wow. What a Sherry! What a monster!\n\nI don\'t think we\'re here on the perfect sherry. On the contrary, it is its slight imperfections and its crazy intensity that give it a crazy charm.\n\nAn extraordinary woody note, on dry, racy noble wood. A bit of molasses, reminiscent of some of the best demerara.\nLuxury leather, perfectly maintained new shoes.\nDried mandarin zest, currant grapes, and a little prune, fig, date.\nCoffee and a little dark chocolate.\nBut above all a diabolical and heady freshness. Camphor, medicinal, bandage, eucalyptus, peppermint. So intense, and yet it doesn\'t crush the rest of the dram.\n\nWe can stay on it for hours.\nTaste\nIn the mouth, this is also the intensity that impresses. Alcohol is perfectly integrated.\nThe noble wood is always present and defines the whole structure of this mouth. Leather, shoe polish, old furniture, old but well maintained.\nThe fruit is cooked, stewed. Cherry, blackberry, blackcurrant; figs.\nBut also the acidity of citrus fruits, fresh and in zest: orange, tangerine.\nWe always have camphor, delicious, which rolls up the fruits.\nA little coffee always, lightly roasted. A little chocolate, dark and milk.\nFinish\nThe final is endless. We find this heady freshness of the nose.\nWe start with the fruit, then toffee, cocoa. We move on to leather, wood, spices, then we continue with citrus zest, and finally camphor, peppermint, eucalyptus.\nWe keep the fruitiness in the mouth for a long time, like a little sweet candy.\nThe empty glass is a delight.

I suggest with the fruit, because that is very prominent. The tropical fruit expected at an old Bowmore, but also pear, such a good juicy ... pineapple (eh, that's tropical for sure?), Lemon, grapefruit ... a pretty superior fruit salad as it were. And what about all that fruit? Well, a lot. To begin with, the oh so great 'farm' sensations: subtle smell of stables, from hay, to the manure. Hu, can we talk about fruit salad with a tuft of manure? Soit, also, what sweet, smoke ... and then I undoubtedly miss a large part. Unbelievably complex and especially intergalactically tasty. Now the taste. Also here a lot of fruit, all kinds of citrus (note for myself: this can be described in the following as 'agrum'), towards the end more inclined towards (bitter) grapefruit.

As expected, this is quite stunning, rather drier and more mentholated and resinous than other very old HPs that I could already try. When I write ‘resinous’, I mean ‘good pine resin’, not what one can find in some fairly extreme young woodbombs. In short, no varnishy resin if you see what I mean. What’s quite striking is that it’s all rather medicinal at very first nosing, and rather closer to some old Islayers. Quite some camphor. As for the way it unfolds after that, it’s all rather epic I must say. At times wonderfully fruity (passion fruits and mango compote), sometimes waxy and ‘polished’ (furniture polish, sandalwood, humidor, tobacco), then we’re back on mint and camphor, then kumquats, then a magnificent spiciness (a precious mix), then roasted nuts (cashews, coffee beans)… It’s just endless. The complexity is amazing yet it’s all very coherent and sort of compact, as it does not go into several directions at the same time. As I sometimes say, it’s a movie-whisky, not a picture-whisky. Mouth: sure it shows its age a bit more than on the nose and sure it’s a tad too ‘concentrated’ (a little bitter oak, strong tea, strong liquorice) but I wouldn’t say that’s a problem, you just have to remember this is a 50yo whisky and respect it. Many spices, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, then bitter almonds, bitters, walnuts, orange zests… It’s also a tad artichoky at times (liqueur)… The background is fruitier, on more oranges and kumquats (crystallised). Finish: long, liquoricy and more herbal. Comments: right. The nose is absolutely fabulous in my opinion, while the palate is very, very nice but I think it’s maybe a tad woody and spicy.

Definitely my top 5 whisky in lifetime.', 'https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/old-rare-an-ardbeg-trio/\n\nTWE says: ‘,… this cask-strength dram is from the 1976 batch of sherry casks that took Ardbeg’s reputation into the stratosphere’. I wonder how much this bottle fetched in 2002?  For the Japanese market, this is another offering I’ve held onto for years now, compliments of ASWhisky.\n\nN: You know it’s incredibly dense, just by the way it falls into the glass. Leathery at first and very intense, it takes a while for the sherried complexities to open out. In fact, I’m not convinced it’s fully opened out after 45 minutes in an open glass, though every time I go to it, I pick out more and more. Indeed ASWhisky says ‘For this Ardbeg you need rest and time he unfolds his treasures only after a good while in the glass drunk too early, he shows something grumpy and old in the mouth’. It goes from bone dry & leathery to classic sherry to salty brine over the course of time, with a profile that is both old skool and contemporary, such is the freshness, the intensity, the vivid vibrancy. Then again, there are fusty overtones that defy this to have been distilled later than 1981 when Ardbeg was mothballed for eight years. It’s worth noting that the distillery closed again in 1996 before Glenmorangie bought the distillery and remaining stock a year later for £7 million. Not accounting for inflation, that’s currently around 9 bottles of 52yo Macallan [MoM]. Now more than an hour later this remains formidable yet it’s a firm but generous nose that gives without shedding. I reckon you could nose this all night, and the same glass would still hold up in the morning. Not sure mine will last that long.\n\nT: Whilst I’d anticipated this would be sweeter and squidgier, the arrival is surprisingly bitter and peated. It definitely needs some water, otherwise, it’s just salty oloroso followed by lots of peat. Water marries the two camps together, where the magic then happens. Aside from all the descriptors that one’s palate may glean or one’s brain conjure, it’s the mouthfeel that defines this one’s appeal. It’s big on everything, but consolidated with water – unlike some Karuizawa’s perhaps that can stay ever-intense and ‘showy’ – this is perfectly congenial. ASWhisky says: ‘You still feel the memories in your mouth hot and spicy but also spicy and soft’. Following on neatly perhaps is a quote I heard today from no other than Gordon Ramsey who says “presentation lasts 30 seconds, it’s the flavour that holds the memory” [Kitchen Nightmares: Series 3 Episode 3: 26 mins].\n\nF: After the oiliest gooey-ist vegetal-sweet~ashy chocolate on earth [with hints of rum, clairins and cachaca], we’ve succulent yet dry ashy > oak briny tannins, the dry-vegetal ashy oiliness remaining buoyant.\n\nC: I can easily see, if you rushed this, that it could be just ‘good’. Give it all the time and help it wants and it shall reward. Though not particularly subtle nor perhaps the emotional jerker I wanted, it is a sherried single cask of excellence from a great vintage year for Ardbeg.', 'An exceptional whisky.\nI got a sample for my birthday.\n\nA clear 95 points', 'Once in a lifetime ... unbelievable', '2395 is certainly one of the best of the 2390s casks so powerful', 'Unquestionably a top-class whisky. Multi-layered and still extremely good. He strongly reminds me of the Special Vatting by Michel Couvreur. A good deal more complex (than the batches I know) and less sherrylastig. But similar in the great combination of sherry, oak and smoke. Absolutely great. Unfortunately, there are slight tart hints, whereas I am allergic. Therefore, there are - I hardly dare to write this word - ""only"" 93 points.\nNose\nFirst there is earthy smoke. Encrusted peat that begins to glow slowly. Then comes a surge of sweetness. Full and intense. Slightly chilling, the smoke stays there, it has something of mint. The chocolaty side of the Sherry comes through. This is not a modern oak and espresso owl. This is Old School, soft and elegant. Grapes and fresh plums. Raisins and this great sweet-sweetie. With some time, the smoke goes back further. As a sweet-maritime seaweed and herbal mixture, it stays there. Slightly sherry notes are now added. Tree bark. Tart wood flashes briefly (to my horror), luckily it evaporates and makes burned caramel place. Popcorn - sweet and salty. Both. Grapefruit also answers. The wine character is getting stronger. Gradually, smoke, sherry and oak come together to form a harmonious unit.\nWater : The unit returns to different components. The smoke is losing. The sweetie hesitates. The fruit takes a step forward, but the oak rushes off. Again slightly acidic wood flashes, again only briefly, and then comes mountain pine. Resin. It settles down again with recurring chocolate in the ""grandiose"" area.\nTaste\nFull sweetie. The mouth is full. Smoke is added immediately, more clearly than in the nose. Tree bark in honey. Smoked orange. Sweet chocolate with pepper and salt. Nutty wine. Licorice. With the swallowing comes seaweed and Isla moss lollipop. Salty, maritime and sweet and bitter to taste. The maritime character in the mouth remains sticky sweet.\nWater : Liquid chocolate. The smoke needs something and does not prevail, only after longer moments he crawls through the pharynx. Rum grape nut chocolate everywhere in the mouth with bark and some sweet moss - crazy. Water does quite well, the whisky does not lose its intensity, it even wins.\nFinish\nLong. Discreetly smoky. Very easily, a bitterness spreads.

Immediately afterwards, old, filigree sherry notes, a basket of overripe red and dark fruits, slightly dry wood notes, minimal hints of smoke, juicy plums and ripe stone fruits reveal themselves. There are also old oak cupboard walls, leather, fruit tobacco and lemon cake. Sweet and almost lovely notes alternate with heavy, mature impressions.\n\nAll of these aromas have often been experienced in old sherries - but what I cannot describe so easily is the elegance with which these aromas are interwoven and integrated.\n\nThe ex-sherry bottlings where I have rated the aroma the best so far are the 32-year-old Linkwood 1988 GM and the well-known 27-year-old Glendronach single barrel # 7434.

It requires more time to be appreciated, but is finally of the same level. The opening of the sample did him good, not modifying so much the present aromas as their hierarchy: the peat was made very discrete whereas the fruits filled the spaces olfactory and gustatory. The minerality has also grown for my greatest happiness. I am forced to review its rating upward with a good 94!\nNose\nThe aeration of the sample played in the good sense. Still fresh, the nose is much more fruity than the previous tasting, with crisp notes of fresh and juicy pineapple and ripe oranges, mango and vanilla. The peat is discreet, but the medicinal notes are always present in the background, as well as the maritime scents. It also has a superb minerality that is growing in the second nose, with a smell that evokes the ""brioschi effervescente"" Italian in their pot (it is small burrs of sweet bicarbonate and flavored with lemon that the mixed with water to make a digestive drink and that bought my grandmother Sicilian but personally I preferred to consume them as such as acidulous candies). My wife is also smelling of olive and my faith is not wrong. All these aromas are linked, entwined, melted together. Long live the OBE! And it may be even better with a little water, which gives more roundness to the whole.\nTaste\nCoherent with the nose, it is very powerful, with a rather greasy texture. Exotic fruits (pineapple) and citrus fruits open the ball, followed by peat before peppery notes come to warm a palate that did not ask much. And always this vegetal freshness at the end of the mouth. It\'s good, very good!\nFinish\nLong, slightly bitter, notes of pineapple and mango, it leaves a slightly searing mineral sensation in the mouth (always brioschi effervescent!)

Then initially follow slightly farm-like flavors, old tillage equipment, leather straps, Oldtimergarage, and kiwi and gooseberry. Over time, it will turn floral to hay, potpurri, and species-rich grassland before fruity notes break in again: waxy kitchen apples, currants and oranges. Finally, an aromatic smoke breaks in, reminiscent of smoked bacon, smoked meat and smoked eel. Truly unbelievable, with every single flavor acting like a grain of sand in an hourglass. With water: even more complex but also more focused the individual main components: thisla diverse honeys, seaweed, Japanese tangcrackers, nut oils, wax, cornelian cherries, currants, citrus zests, salt, but also farm-like notes and coffee roasting.

Then vegetable notes but also bacon, Scamorza, Tang, tidal pools, citrus zests, hay, straw bales, old barn, yes almost even stable? Now followed by freshly dug up bed, old tillage equipment, old agricultural machinery, industrial port, jute, old oak, and the subtle fruitiness of Johannisberen and bittersweet apple varieties.

So you may have to spend £6,995.00\non the whisky plus around £29.99 on an air ticket (Easyjet or Ryanair,\nyour call). Or you rent a jet if you’d like the whole experience to be\nmore prestigious. Something that I really like, also, is what’s written\non the bottle, “Proud survivor of a legendary distillery”. If it’s\nproud, it’s got a soul, and I always thought great old whiskies were\nhaving a soul… There, new evidence! Colour: gold. Nose: oh, no! I\nremember when we were downing the various 22yo Rare Malts like if there\nwere no tomorrow (I may well be exaggerating a bit here, I’m a bit like\nStirling Moss and his famous line ‘the older I get, the faster I was.’\nThe older I get, the more Brora 1972 I drank, haha), so yeah, when we\nwere having Brora 22 72, they were all utterly brilliant, but always a\nlittle rough around the edges… Well, the nose of this 40 is utterly\nbrilliant and its edges have been wonderfully polished with all sorts of\nprecious waxes and oils. What strikes me as well is that we’re getting\nvery close to the best old Ardbegs from the same era. Maybe even above\nthem if, like me, you enjoy a kind of tenseness in your whisky. I don’t\nknow why, it’s just a feeling… Maybe that’s these stunning\nresinous/sappy notes, or this medicinal side that was less obvious in\nthe younger 1972 Broras.\n\n\nOther\nthan that and because we haven’t gotten all day, let me just mention\nolive oil, cigars, menthol, teak oil, smoked oysters, drops of diesel,\nSpanish ham, special brine, vetiver, verbena, sugar cane… So a truly\nfabulous nose, a real movie. With water (because you see, we must):\nastounding clarity and freshness, that’s all I’ll say. Mouth (neat):\namazing. A tidal wave, the arrival’s incredibly smooth for Brora, and\nthen it never stops growing, getting bigger, hitting harder, invading\nyour palate and leaving you totally breathless (which could even be a\nlittle dangerous, seriously). It’s a symphony, or a long suite by the\nDuke Ellington Orchestra. You don’t control anything, the whisky\ncontrols you, which is a weird feeling I have to say. A wonderful, but\nweird feeling. Excuse me? Flavours? I’d say grapefruits, oysters, peat\nsmoke, beech smoke (smoked salmon), touches of ink, wasabi, earth,\nsamphire, lemon curd… And bags and bags of other flavours, the list is\njust too long, someone could build a whole website just for this baby.\nFull maturity but absolutely no signs of tiredness, quite the opposite. I\ndon’t know why, Tilda Swinton’s name pops in my mind, probably because\nshe’s Scottish. With water (which might be useless but we do follow\nprocedures at WF Towers, mind you): a.m.a.z.i.n.g. Waxy and smoky\ncitrus. Utter perfection. Finish: it’s the freshness that’s impressive\nhere. An endless list of flavours, all coated with the most refined\nsmoke in Scotland. Comments: I don’t think I’ve mentioned oak, have I?\nThat’s whisky, when you don’t feel any oak. I’d add that I actually\nstarted Whiskyfun.com because of Brora, and this expression is the kind\nof whisky that keeps me going. I think this has been too long,\napologies.

New distilled spirit was poured into oak casks, much the same as any other day at Bowmore Distillery. However, the spirit within casks numbered 216-220 was to become special.Bowmoreâ€™s Distillery Manager nurtured and monitored this spirit through the years, as with all casks of Bowmore, waiting for the day when he knew the whisky was at its prime. Over time, the spirit rested quietly in the No 1 Vaults of Bowmore Distillery, breathing in the fresh sea air and developing its unique Bowmore personality.Ten, twenty, thirty years passed by and still the spirit in those five casks wished to slumber. Its brothers had long since matured. The Distillery Manager knew that something unique was developing in the casks and kept a careful vigil over them. However, in its thirty eighth year, the spirit was found sitting just above the critical 40% alcoholic volume strength for Scotch Whisky and so he moved with haste to have the whisky bottled. If he had waited a moment longer, the whisky would have become extinct, and a piece of history wiped out forever.The precious spirit was soon bottled and placed in this handmade oak presentation case, carefully crafted by the Master Cabinet Makers of Charles Kirkby & Sons, Sheffield, England.This unique autumnal coloured Bowmore should be given time in the glass to open up, time for the Bowmore character to release itself. To preserve every last drop of character in this fine whisky, we decided not to chill filter it. Should water be added, it may alter in appearance, acquiring a natural soft haze.As one of only 861 bottles ever produced, this bottle of Bowmore 1957, aged Thirty Eight Years, is a true gem in the Bowmore family.\n\nhttp://www.bowmore.co.uk/Bowmore.aspx']",WB200,Single Malt,Bowmore,,38 years old,,40.1 % Vol.,700 ml,6,"['dram-drinker', 'Barchager', 'GLEN', 'Deloti', 'Deloti', 'Laird']","['94', '96', '', '96', '96', '']"

After a few minutes, floral notes explode in the glass together with deep wax leather and nutty malt-sugar, followed by amazing and complex fruitiness. The mineral and slightly earthy maltiness conveys a clear provenance of Campbeltown and contributes a thick mouthfeel as well as a wonderfully long finish. Every sip is maximally harmonious.\nThe core of the experience is the malt, beeswax, and vanilla aromas in perfect harmony with the incredibly intense minerality. It's less dirty and funky than most old-school Springbanks I've tried, but not in the least less complex. Whereas, the intensity of all these aromas is unparalleled, in my experience. You can absolutely spend 3 to 4 hours with a small dram and the scent will fill the whole room."", ""When I got into whisky this bottling had been on top of the WhiskyBase TOP1000 list.

To be honest this bottle is a kind of legend in it's league, by having TOP1 in base over several years in the past, I cannot leave a simple comment as highly recommended, this one should have a well deserved place in the best of the best's league.

The palate is rich and vibrant with no fatigue from the 40 years of ageing, it delivers the same abundance of flavour from nose, with eucalyptus candy, coconut oil, banana bread, wood smoke, lavender candle, sweet earl grey tea, herbal smoke and nougat. The finish is slightly shorter than one might expect given the other-worldly expressiveness of the nose and palate, but still long by any mere mortal metric, with the creamy tropical fruits coming back to the fore - apricot yoghurt, pineapple and vanilla, golden kiwi with custard, finely balanced out with some black pepper and eucalyptus smoke. A huge dram.', 'I sincerely hope that wb users will be more sincere and less scoring based on the standard. Genting + 60s + Shirley barrel + height number + senior wine age must be equal to high score?\nNose\nThe impact of Shirley barrels is very insignificant. Compared with the OB 32yo of 1971, it may be closer to the local barley of Bourbon barrels in 1966. First of all, it is worthy of recognition that after such a long aging, the body of the wine is very good. The blind tasting may be guessed at the range of 20~24yo. Genting’s iconic coconut milk and cheese have a trace of what Teacher Zheng said. Abnormal feelings, milkshake, honey, pudding, warm but not greasy, steady and sharp, light floral fragrance and temperate fruits, vanilla, sea salt, peat are not easy to capture, it is a fresh and refreshing charcoal fire, powerful performance The true color of octopus in the winery.\nTaste\nIf 32 is that the wine body is slightly past its peak and the flavor is still there, this one is definitely a general white head. There are not many elements in the direction of woody nuts, but it can let you know that the fruity flavor is loose and the wine body has become weak. , More spicy, white pepper and the like, bitter flavors such as peat and sea salt suppress the sweetness of fruits and cheese.\n\nStrong, normal fat, slightly sweet, no acid, no tannins, no astringency, little bitterness, no pungency, no alcohol.\nFinish\nLonger time, wax, fat, white and sweet.', 'By far the oldest jumper from the Signatory series from 1969 with a fabulous reputation and an extreme average value on the base.

There are whispers of tobacco leaves and menthol, but also blackberries. Touches of aceto di balsamico, prunes and crème de cassis, but also chocolate and raisins. You get the gist, right? It’s greatness in a glass and shares similarities with older brandies. Perfectly — and I mean flawlessly — integrated.\nTaste\nThere’s this sweet arrival with dried dates and Demerara sugar, but also eucalyptus and a whiff of star anise, supported by a tiny pinch of black pepper as well as some strong coffee and leather. Then more raisins and chocolate. Damp oak and tobacco leaves. Some drier notes, but they’re kept very much in check. And again it’s integrated and balanced.\nFinish\nLong. Some cloves. A tad dry.

No capitulation here. This is a superstar. Through and through. Cohesive. Complex. Cowabunga! This is spellbindingly delicious. At almost 60% but absolutely does not feel it! Probably the only whisky I've had at 60% where all the flavors, minute or otherwise, can be tasted easily... clearly and well-defined.\nFinish\n96\n96\nI am privileged to have tasted this."", 'This old whisky is striking: on the nose it is clearly recognizable as a Glen Grant of the 1950s, but it could also be a very old Armagnac; the aromas of old, damp wine cellars, black tea and a slightly musty library speak for themselves; as well as the ripe berries that gradually appear. The dense consistency as well. The 59.4% is not noticeable at all, it just adds vibrancy.\n\nBut the strength on the palate reports and leads to a perfect mouthfeel between density, intensity, fruitiness, spiciness and black tea notes. The mouthfeel is clearly the greatest, as this is where the fruit and a subtle freshness come to the aged notes. The finish develops over time and is expectedly long. Overall the best whisky I\'ve had in my glass so far.\nNose\n97\n97\nI am immediately in the old wine cellar, dusty books. Old Bottle Flavor (although the malt was in cask until 2021). The relationship to Glen Grant 1956 (WB12047) is unmistakable! And the aromatic relationship to very old Armagnacs, especially the Claveries, as well. Old choir stalls in a cool and damp church. Black tea. The ripe berries are already appearing behind them. Sherry and Madeira, boiled down a bit. A super dense concentrate, the 59.4% cannot be felt. The development in the Premium Snifter is particularly beautiful: First, a full jug of old wine cellars, a confessional, and damp moss. Gradually, i.e. every half hour, then the fruits and strong wines announce themselves. In terms of consistency and density, it is closer to the very old Armagnacs than to the very old Cognacs.\nTaste\n98\n98\nAccording to the 59%, the Grant comes into the mouth full of sherry, sweet with plums and berries, pregnant with Madeira. Tea notes follow, the damp wine cellar, moss and forest soil. That\'s just great.\nFinish\n97\n97\nThat such a spirit has a ""long finish"" was to be expected. And is slightly understated. The dark notes report in waves from the wine cellar to the confessional to the damp moss, then sherry and Madeira, then blueberries and blackberries again, followed by the pleasantly tart black tea.', '4209, 4450, 4451 side by side\n\nAll insanely fantastic sherry bombs.

Hey, whisky is made for drinking! Finally I managed to buy a reasonable-sized sample (6cl) from a bottle-sharing and so I am in the pole position to write the first review (here at WB)...\n\n...and what a review! This is the stuff whisky dreams are made of, at least mine. I never scored any dram 98 points so far but after 5000+ different drams tasted I think it is time to break this tradition (and still I can do a 99 points score if an even better dram crosses my way after the next 5000+ tastings). What is absolutely astonishing about this Glen Grant is the fact that the taste is even better than the nose, usually the nose is excellent on very long-matured drams but the taste often fails to meet this high quality level. Enough said, as I like to enjoy the rest of my sample without intellectual exercises.\n\n[July, 2021] I re-tasted this dram tonight and still I am flashed by both its quality and liveliness after 67 years of maturation. To me, this is the most interesting spirit I ever tasted (so far).\nNose\n97\n97\nThe colour is mahogany and of course I use a big spherical blender's glass to nose this old beauty. The first sniff right after serving is very impressive already with dozens of different interwoven aromas from all three the malt, the sherry and the wood. It takes quite a while until my olfactory cells adapt to this onrush of aromas and it takes even longer until they manage to separate the different impressions. For a detailed description please refer to the excellent reviews of Serge and Angus at whiskyfun.com because they own better senses than I do. Nonetheless, I enjoy this nose at least as much as they did (maybe even a little more) because it is not just extremely complex and flawless but perfectly balanced and full of interesting nuances too. Take your time with this nose as it improves greatly upon oxidation, my score started at 93 right after serving but then improved one point every 15 minutes until it finally reached its peak after around one hour of breathing and some drops of water. Remember, old drams demand patience!\nTaste\n98\n98\nUsually the taste of very old drams cannot match their nose but this one is different. This taste is even better! I cannot believe the initial signals from my taste buds so I have to take a quick second sip and it confirms an immense onrush of delicate flavours which is hard to match even by the best drams I had so far (and I had a lot of excellent drams over the last 25+years). This taste is multi-multi-multi layered and if you are able to chew this dram for at least three minutes it offers a myriad of impressions in an endless procession of flavours across your taste buds. Again, please refer to Serge and Angus for details as they stated all flavours already I am able to identify. But what strikes me most is the unbelievable harmony of the holy whisky trinity in this taste - malt, sherry and wood march hand in hand and without the slightest wrestling for dominance as if they fell in love to each other a long time ago and this love has constantly grown over the years married together. Wow, what a taste - I am flashed, to be honest.\nFinish\n98\n98\nThe arrival of this dram is absolutely flabbergasting with an immense power and freshness that I never thought was possible after 67 years of maturation. It instantly coats all parts of my mouth with a creamy and warming texture and the best about this mouthfeel is: It is completely free of any distracting bitter or drying moments, this is a triple wow-surprise for a 67-years old dram. The finish is virtually endless and fades very slowly in different vanishing waves again without any distracting astringent or unpleasant bitter notes. Are there new impressions during the finish? Of course, but it is almost impossible to describe them as the taste was over-complex already. Some drops of water release a whole set of new impressions in the nose and turn the taste a little more punchy and smooth at the same time which seems to be a contradiction but actually it is what it is. Unfortunately, the different layers start to intermingle now as it happens so often on reduced levels of very complex old drams. A further reduction smooths both nose and taste and the layers are almost gone now - I prefer the neat dram to be honest (at its flabbergasting 59.4% abv after 67 years of maturation, I still cannot believe this...)."", '[May, 2021] Wow, what a flabbergasting butt! After 67 years of maturation this cask yielded still 355 bottles at astonishing 59.4% abv. I certainly have to try a dram (or two)...\n\n...and I want to meet that funny WB member who tagged ""coal-gas"" already (but nothing else and no score either). Just to be clear about the ""coal-gas"" which usually indicates sulphur-spoiled casks: The practice of treating sherry casks with burning sulphur candles to prevent them from rotting in the hot Spanish climate before they were shipped to Scotland was introduced in 1983 (and stopped several years later when the distilleries discovered how badly this practice spoiled their whisky). So a dram filled into a cask in 1953 (and never was re-racked) could never ever develop such flavours. But maybe the mysterious member knows something all others do not?\n\nActually, another member had a perfect explanation for this tagging - here is what he/she wrote: ""The coal-gas icon is the first one of the list and very often it is clicked on unintentionally.

A very convenient result as I can declare a draw ;-) - I swear it is not manipulated...\nNose\nThe colour of the BB is of brown sherry while the 57 is about four shades paler at tawny. The 57 shows a few slow legs and fat tears while the BB has many fast legs and very few late tears. The nose of the BB offers a very rich and bold sherry driven profile (raisins, coffee beans, chocolate...) with only a few tropical fruity aromas (mangos, passion fruits). The 57 is rather subtle and delicate on sherry and a lot more of fruits (blackcurrants, passion fruits, mango, mirabelle, oranges). Some hints of smoke here that are harder to detect in the BB. I find the 57 more balanced and of greater complexity while the BB is heavier and more rich. So everyone choose what he/she prefers - I like the more delicate and complex 1957 a little better.\nTaste\nThe taste of the BB shows a very rich and complex profile of dried tropical fruits and chocolate, very delicious. Some toffee flavours too and even hints of peaty aromas. Yes it comes in different layers that are peeled one after the other by the taste buds. Same with the 57: A highly layered taste too, maybe even some layers more. Especially at the end there is a (almost funny) little fruity explosion again, as if it will set a last highlight for the finish. Nevertheless the 57 is not as rich as the BB but very balanced on sweet, fruity and slightly peaty flavours. I call this harmony and vote for a draw...\nFinish\nThe 57 comes very smooth and rather gentle (if not shy) to the mouth with a slight peppery and woody note in the end. Nevertheless it is mouth-coating and even chewy. The BB arrives bold and rich - it instantly coats all of the mouth. The 57\'s finish is of medium length and adds some spicy flavours (among them surprisingly a little saltiness) as well as milk chocolate to its already impressive profile. But it is a little weakish in terms of overall strength. Contrary to this the BB\'s finish is longer and richer but with some bitter notes (tannins) in the end (not unpleasantly). It comes in several nice waves too and I like it better than the flatter 57\'s.\n\nAs I thought it might be a sacrilege to the beauty of these drams I did not add any water to both.', '[November, 1999]  I had another dram during the millennium tasting at Kyrburg. \n\nIn my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored this 95.

But just to put the ""out-of-mind"" price points of this dram into perspective: There are a lot of other drams from around the same time which offer a very comparable tasting experience, e.g. from Tamnavulin, Tamdhu, Inchgower to mention a few (or the better known sherry monsters from Glen Grant, Glenfarclas or Glendronach). It is not so much the malt which defines this great taste but the unmatched sherry casks available around that time. So if you just want to try such a taste go for other releases without the name ""Samaroli"" on the label because these are just collector\'s and Investor\'s items these days, unfortunately.\nNose\n93\n93\nThe colour is extremely dark at brown sherry and the nose offers a rich and impressive dark oloroso profile. This is a textbook old-style sherry maturation without flaws or off-notes which was bottled at the right time (after 16 years) before the wood turns too aggressive. The mysterious bottle maturation might have improved this dram further, surely. Great stuff to sniff, but it is not unique. There were more drams of this quality out there than most people think but almost all of them have been emptied shortly after they were sold because of its excellent taste (and are forgotten now, almost). But hey, that is what whisky is made for!\nTaste\n95\n95\nThe taste offers everything a connoisseur of the old-style sherry maturations is looking for, in several well separated layers which are both fun and enjoyable to investigate. The malt plays a walk-on role only but it is not completely buried beneath the heavy sherry flavours, luckily. But to be honest, I am not able to state if this is the best Tormore (malt) ever because of that. But certainly this is the best Tormore bottling I tasted so far, thanks to the perfect sherry casks. It is very comparable to the heavily sherried Tamnavulin from around the same time, e.g. WB id 8777 or the 1967 Inchgower WB id 27095.\nFinish\n95\n95\nThe initial mouthfeel is hot and peppery due to the high abv and it coats the whole of my mouth within seconds with a creamy texture (so the spirit was of a high quality too). The finish is long and elaborates further on the different chocolatey and herbal-spicy impressions. No bitter or astringent moments att all, this dram was bottled at the right time.

Let’s cherish these notes, because no super-dopey\nquickly aged modern whiskies will ever display them, however good they\nare. Let’s not list them all, that would be much too long, but there are\nnotes of ancient oranges, Szechuan pepper, barley sugar (right, that\ncan be found in young whiskies as well), natural vanilla, bitter cocoa,\nmany many spices (let’s call that the old-whisky spice mix, with cloves,\ncinnamon, nutmeg and other spices). And many other notes… Finish:\nmedium long, with the oak starting to appear more clearly, but always in\nan elegant manner. Some mint and pine resin like often in very, very\nold casks. Comments: I’m sure some taster have or will think that this\nold one is a tad too woody and drying in the finish, but I do not quite\nagree. There is some oak but it’s perfectly integrated and I cannot see\nhow a 45yo whisky would not display a little wood and quite a tannicity.\nSo, I think this one is fantastic but I agree it’d better be, at this\nprice.

Max McFarlane, Highland Park Whisky Maker, said; “The casks allowed the delicate fragrance of the original spirit to shine through without being overpowered by the oak notes. This distinctive, aromatic fragrance derives from hand-turned malt which has been dried over Orkney’s heather-based peat. In addition, the peaceful, extended maturation in Orkney’s cool climate has resulted in a whisky of remarkable complexity.”\n\nTasting Notes by Highland Park\nNose\nRedolent of toasted oak, dried strawberries and shellac with a generouscoating of beeswax.\nTaste\nDelicious sweetness combined with a fascinating spiciness; crushed black pepper, crème brûlée and toasted vanilla pod add to the complexity.\nFinish\nRich, long, lingering spiciness completes the sensational tasting experience of this venerable single malt.', '""Bottled in 2009 from two refill hogsheads, this Highland Park 1964 is\n\nthe inaugural release in the distillery`s Orcadian Vintage series.

An ancient, salty, almost crusty palo cortado aroma with further notes of bacon, rancio, ancient balsamic, hessian, damp sack cloth and black olives in brine.

Soft peat mixed with the best that a sherry barrel can give a whisky. For the associations at the nose please see, I am going to enjoy ... Long finish, perfectly in line with the rest.

Let's try to go in order: the marine world is all there, between iodine notes and dried algae, and next to this a very slight peat. Then, pure delirium, the universe of the world: sweet almond, vanilla (the noumena of vanilla, a ur-vanilla!), Fresh coconut, cider / apple juice, ripe kiwi; Meringue. Orange marmalade; creamy (lemon cream, prepared for cakes). Then there is also a vegetal, herbaceous side, even if with flushes: licorice, anise; tea leaves. Closing your eyes, it seems to enter a pastry shop; then close them again and it feels like being by the sea; close them again and stand in front of a fireplace ... Total experience. You never feel the need to add water, we think about the weather and the air to keep this whisky in constant evolution.\n\nP: WOW! Never tasted such a thing. Of great consistency with respect to the nose: we are not repeating what is written on the nose, but the range of sweet flavors (still among almond, vanilla, orange marmalade, tropical fruit) affects the tongue in flames, while the general sensation on the palate is of a truly amazing salted smoking. This intensity is perhaps the only deviation from the nose, which foreshadowed a less marked smoke: it is precisely the intensity of the smoking that strikes after 30 years in cask ...\n\nF: never stops, a long ending until the next day ... Infinite and powerful. Ash, peat, extinguished fireplace. Tips, here and there, of mint and lemon. A little salt. Bitter orange juice.\n\nThe summary of all the words spent so far is: spectacular. The opportunities to taste whisky of this quality and this age are physiologically reducing over time, but we can guarantee that it is worth it. It is a different experience, superior, as well as educationally useful: it helps to move the bar of need upwards and to relocate much of what is usually drunk into a dimension of 'normality'. Everything is harmonious in this whisky: complexity, balance, intensity of aromas ... Everything blends perfectly, it is one and a hundred whisky together.\n\nhttp://whiskyfacile.com/2012/01/26/ardbeg-19722003-ob-for-velier-499/"", 'Tasting note by Serge Valentin\n\nArdbeg 1972/2003 (49.9%, OB for Italy, VELIER, cask #2782, 246 bottles) An old glory that I already tried on Islay at the time but it’s time for a quieter and more thorough tasting. For some reason, part of this batch was shipped back from Italy to the distillery where they used to sell these glorious bottles for as little as £50 (shhhh, just between us, no ‘official’ price). Now it’s worth £1,000+ at the greediest sellers’. Free market, yeah, yeah… Colour: pale gold. Nose: simply a wilder version of the newer DL. The profile is exactly the same, only ‘louder’. Mouth: right, right, it’s all happening on the palate. Once again, the profile is very similar to the DL’s but this official is much bigger, oomphier, more satisfying and, well, punchier. You know that a whisky is great when you become short of descriptors, that is to say when the only descriptor you can come up with is ‘great old Ardbeg’. That’s exactly what’s happening now. Finish: maybe not the longest ever (old sherried Ardbegs may be longer) but totally wonderful. Comments: a breed that’s currently disappearing, that’s why these bottles fetch such high prices at auctions. Somewhat like a dead painter whose prices skyrocket at Sotheby’s or Christie’s, just because everybody knows that there will be no more. Ever. It’s probably the case here.

Nose: yes it does remind me of the no-less famous 12 yo for Samaroli. This is simply amazing, with all dimensions involved. So a huge complexity, even at this very high strength, with first, all kinds of raisins plus prunes and marzipan-filled dates, then a wee blend of other stunning old spirits (mainly cognac and rum), then all waxes and oils of the creation as well as the rarest aromatic herbs. You may forget about ‘rarest’. What an experience… With water: not the best use of water ever, the whisky doesn’t change much. Well, it couldn’t have gotten any better anyway… Mouth (neat): where to start? This is big, this is huge, this is as rich and yet elegant and even kind of refreshing as the grandest Montrachet (Serge, we’re getting tired of your wine quotes). The only tiny-wee-ish flaw is an infinitesimal soapiness. Otherwise we have more or less the same aromas as in the nose. With water: please immediately call the anti-maltoporn brigade. And water killed that faint soapiness, unsurprisingly. Finish: long and now rather spicier. Cloves and mint first, which keeps it all fresh, then crystallised ginger and a little paprika. Comments: grand, very grand. Great spirit from some superb sherry casks. And I liked the touch of soap at some point, that kept this whisky human.

Despite it's high abv it's still very waxy, oily, peppery but smooth. The finish never ends. It does not even need water necessarily.

Right away, there's definite fruitiness, but oddly enough, it strikes me more on the fresh side: red berries. There are some light spices there, too, but they really don't assert themselves too much yet. When nosing deeply, I get a faint trace of furniture polish. As it begins to develop in the glass, a more prominent earthy feel begins to increase. These last few things reveal a bit of the wood and age. Serge sometimes talks about cough syrup in whisky (in a positive sense), and this one is giving off some of that: very classy, expensive cough syrup. On yet another whiff, there is now brown sugar coming through. Wow, on the next, it's turning savory--light soy sauce, gamey meat. Even later, I finally get some light tropical fruits. The complexity is through the roof here--one might even call this a mercurial dram.\n\nTaste: The initial hit is dry sherry. The mouthfeel is not particularly viscous and there's no real heat to speak of here. There is a caramel note, but it's darker and much less sweet than what you'd normally expect.

Reverberation: Aroma, take over the elements of flavor together. A condensed grape feeling from Sherry cask and a pleasant convergence reminiscent of bitter chocolate. The sweetness of the melon still continues, and with the slight spicyness it also has an impression like chilli chocolate. The reverberation is very long. I think that it was recently talked about around 2014 that I enjoyed the taste of long-term aged sake of Glen Grassa relatively abundantly, but perhaps this taste is treated as a lost taste in the future I think that it is. To the extent that it seems so, Glen Grassa is a whisky with a wonderfully rich and complex flavor, which makes me feel reminiscent of melons that I can not see at all these days. The historic Glen Grassa Distillery, founded in 1875, has been closed once in 1986. After a long closing period, on December 4, 2008, New Make Spirits flowed down again from the still, and sake brewed three years later was released as ""Glen Grassa Revival"" in 2012. My honest impression is that I do not know what kind of flavor the new sake after the resumption of distillation will acquire through aging in the coming years, to be honest. Regarding the sake after the resumption of distillation about the same long-term maturation as the bottle, perhaps it may be impossible to drink while she is alive. That\'s why this whisky distilled in 1972 is a precious liquor distilled before closing the distillery. Here is the reason why the taste of long-term aged sake of Glen Grassa may be lost, but this bottle is used for aging due to the complex flavor acquired by sake by long aging This rich mellow sweetness obtained from Sherry Cask (Sherry Bat), I think that it is a rather rare bottle, which holds almost the balance close to miracles. I\'m not drinking so much Glenter 1970 Distilling Glen Grassa, but this bottle is Glen Grassa feels that it has the perfection of its highest in my history.\nWell, basically, when I taste the whisky, the glasses are unified in Glencairn, but with regard to this whisky, we can also taste the tasting together with a large glass of ""Burgundy · Grand Cru"" which is released from Riedel (The big glass on the left of the bottle in the picture shows that the tasting notes describe what was done at the bottle right Glencane.) I think that Riedel\'s glass of Burgundy, Grand Cru was widely informed among whisky drinkers among the whisky drinkers thought that Mr. Katsuhiko Takemoto who is hosting whiskylink is the achievement, but just by changing the glass anyway, this whisky\'s A sweet flavor like a freshly ripe melon fruit having it is drawn out at once and it makes me feel really happy when I drink it. Using this glass makes you almost impossible to feel like oily and pasture grass and I think that the experience of thinking that the influence of the glass on the flavor of whisky is beyond imagination (Riedel\'s glass is quite satisfactory I seem to be selling rarely, I asked someone I got acquainted through whisky at that time.If it is a fixed price it is a very expensive glass, but I think that it was good to buy it. So we treat it quite carefully). I think that pursuing how to taste your own drinks deliciously is one of the ways to enjoy a number of whiskys, but to enjoy changing the flavor of whisky while changing the glasses variously This is one way of pursuit. Alongside food mariage, I do not think that it is one of worth doing https://drinkerslounge.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/glenglassaugh-1972-2014-41y-50-6-cask 2114-sherry-butt-582bottles-rare-cask-release/', ""It's just excellent.\nNose\nFruity.

I had thought our German friends had ‘stolen’ all the casks. It’s true that their bottlings had been super-fab (for example, #2896, WF 93). Colour: deep amber. Nose: there was definitely something with 1972 at many distilleries. The most wonderful combination of honeys and ripe plums, blended with some Sauternes and PX of the highest quality (not touristy ones). And it all blends well! With water: some wonderful complexity – while it wasn’t too complex when undiluted. Wet chalk, the same kind of sandalwood as in the 30, a little marzipan and putty… And always this marvellous honeyness. The wonders of refill casks! Mouth (neat): exceptional, in my opinion. Same winning combo as on the nose, ripe plums and apricots, Sauternes, juicy golden raisins, then a slice of cinnamon cake, and perhaps a little tobacco. Forgot to mention honey. It’s amazing that the oak – because some oak there is – never gets in the way. With water: just b***y perfect. Do they have some kind of de-oakening machine? Because once again, you feel the oak, but the whisky never gets oaky. Wonderful sweet spiciness. Finish: medium, always with this impeccable honeyed profile. It’s got something oriental, with this sandalwood, the very soft curry sauce, and all that. Ravishing. Comments: me want to know what happened in 1972 over there on Scotland! Imagine, according to Wikipedia, even the pipe band of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards released their instrumental recording of ‘Amazing Grace’ in 1972, which reached No. 1 in the UK!

Just as before, while tasting about 200 samples in a short time (4~6 weeks), it's very hard to keep sensitive at every tasting moment.

The fact that he is also 40 years old is of course an additional dream, but you don't notice the whisky. I don't have to think long here, because the nose already shows that I've never had a whisky like this in my glass.\nNose\n97\n97\nThe first nose in Blenders is (still blind and without the knowledge of the distillery) simply: what the fuck? This is a bubbly fruit punch and I would never have guessed at 40 years because the aromas are still dancing so lively. Which flavors should I list here, I'll start with passion fruit, mango, physalis, even banana, peach etc. I didn't blindly tap on a Bowmore either - of course not! - but after 20 minutes I also have a slightly salty one here Note and that is the first hint of an Islay for me, because peat smoke is not to be found here.\n\nThis is the counterpart to my other highest rated whisky to date, Tomatin 1965 Jack Wieber, which is black. This one shines with brightness.\nTaste\n96\n96\nOh man, what can I say, I have to grin, because what is happening here on the palate is such a crazy interplay of bubbly fruit bowl, tropical, ripe sweetness and salty oiliness. Here is the first indication that it might actually have been stored in the barrel for more than a decade - but you would never come up with a full four decades in a blind tasting. And I would be disappointed with another malt because I expect and wish for a light oak note in old malts. It probably wouldn't go with this lively and fun-loving whisky here, so it's ok that the oak beckons cautiously from the background.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe finish is long and mouth filling, again not bitter at all.

I bought this bottle (no. 12) for 345 Euro in June, 2006...\n\n...and it was an excellent investment. This dram offers the best what both Bowmore and the 1960ies distillations can offer - a flawless and unbelievably complex profile that offers almost all delicious fruits available on this planet in a perfect wooden framework. Is this worth the extraordinary prices of today? Well, if you can afford it: Yes (compared to modern releases of that price range) and No (compared to other great drams of the past which cost still a fraction of this price, even today). But if you ever come across a Bowmore sample from the sixties - go for it!\n\n[August, 2021] I raise another dram to Roland who passed away two nights ago - R.I.P.! Roland was one of the very first Germans who went into rare old single malt whiskies as early as the beginning of the eighties and he introduced me into this beautiful world of wonders with hundreds of excellent drams in his well-equipped cellar. May the gods who invented whisky be on your side now...\n\n...and I salute with a head-to-head of the two sister cask of the 40 years old Bowmore vintage 1966 #3316 (WB id 2191) and #3317 (WB id 2192). This is absolute top-level stuff and in a direct comparison I prefer the nose of #3316 a little over #3317 while the latter offers both a better palate and finish but all is 95+points without any doubt from both my olfactory cells and taste buds. These drams are for all faithfully departed!\nNose\n98\n98\nThe colour is russetmuscat and the nose offers this glorious all-fruits profile of mid-sixties Bowmore which simply is adorable. As if I walk across a tropical fruits market with all the stands made of old oak woods. I take a sniff here and there, all the fruits are ripe and juicy so it is hard to decide which one I like the most. This is one of these noses I could sniff forever and I have to push myself to take a first sip...\nTaste\n96\n96\n...which offers almost the same extraordinary profile on the palate. This is a fruit salad mixed out of all the most delicious fruits I can think of (both home-grown and exotic) with a clear dominance of tropical impressions. Forget about bar cocktails, this is the best-stirred cocktail of flavours my taste buds ever enjoyed. And it is well-structured by very appropriate wooden notes which are firm but never dominating. This taste is deeply layered and each layer is peeled off one after the other with maximum pleasure. Beside the fruits and wooden impressions there are waxes and vegetable oils, spices and herbs, earthy and nutty flavours and many more to explore. I wonder how many different flavours and aromas a trained nose can detect within this dram - it must be more than fifty, I guess. Fabulous.\nFinish\n95\n95\nThe initial mouthfeel is fantastic with a warming and creamy texture covering all of my mouth within seconds. No bitter or astringent moments at all (after 40 years of maturation, wow!). The finish is virtually endless, even fifteen minutes after I swallowed a sip I still can taste this beautiful profile without any distracting drying impressions. Right at the end, when almost all other flavours have vanished the barley sugars come out of the dark, and they are tasty too. Water is not needed, this dram is perfect as it is.', ""stellar fruit in this exceptional bowmore. Sixties Bowmore as it should be... 'kattepis' blue berries, brambles.

Colour: gold. Nose: otherworldly. Look, let’s keep this short and sweet: it’s a class of its own, different from the Bowmores from the 1960s in the sense that the latter were fruitier and less peaty, whilst this displays the most exceptional combination of peat smoke and tropical fruits (mostly citrus this time). A S.T.U.N.N.I.N.G. combo. Mouth: this is why we’re into whisky. Grapefruits, spearmint, peat, lemon marmalade, angelica, woodruff, high-end walnut liqueur, 3,765 different spices, 4,623 different fruits, 7,598 different ‘phenolic’ aromas… Well, I’m sure you get the picture. Finish: does ‘the peacock’s tail’ several times in a row, like the greatest old wines, the most wonderful peatiness being a permanent feature. Comments: we had always thought that straight peat did not stand long ageing – including bottle ageing – but this is an example of a very old whisky (a 30+20, that is to say 30 years in wood plus 20 years in glass) that kept all of its peatiness. Drawback: this makes many recent whiskies taste a tad, say ridiculous and pretentious. SGP:666 (devilish indeed) - 96 points.', ""I was expecting a lot, maybe too much. Obviously, it's delicious, but this Bowmore would have really deserved a few more degrees to be a slaughter. The nose is still memorable.\nNose\nAn exotic bomb. Fruits of passion, apricots.

I do not perceive any peat or smoke.\nTaste\nOn the palate, we have a taste of old and reduced. Unfortunately we feel quickly that this Bowmore lacks a little punch.

This is among the best Ardbeg ever did and very different to today\'s Ardbeg style, no wonder all these old vintages fetch extremely high prices at auctions. Ardbeg from 1972-1975 is certainly a must try for every malt whisky connoisseur, at least once in your life.\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is amber and the nose offers this hard-to-describe early seventies Ardbeg profile which a good friend called ""licking a tarred road in front of a cowshed at the Islay ocean shore on a hot summer day"". But he forgot the ""peat-fired barbecue with crispy bacon stripes"" and the ""used antiseptic bandages"". Got me? This all sounds horrific but actually it is great to sniff (according to my olfactory cells) and extremely interesting to explore.\nTaste\n96\n96\nThe taste is multi-layered on all the flavours one could imagine given the nosing profile. The barley sugars provide a strong sweetness to back up the rather bitter peaty and wooden notes and this is a great combination. I suggest to chew each and every sip as long as one can because it offers new impressions almost every second. Hard to describe them all, so I leave this to more competent taste buds.\nFinish\n95\n95\nTh e dram arrives warming without distracting moments on my palate and immediately coats all of my mouth with a thick creamy texture. The finish is endless and adds more sweet barley sugars, spicy woods and medicinal impressions until the very end. Nothing to complain about, this finish is close to perfection. Some water turns the nose punchier and releases chalky-mineral notes while the taste gets much more peppery hot. A bigger reduction strengthens the farmyard and medicinal impressions both in the nose and on the palate which I really enjoy.

Inside the pulley is a long cork labeled Bowmore Bicentenary, which is guaranteed not to come out at once, so crumbs are preprogrammed.\nOf these, there were 24,000 pieces. Of these, the normal one was filled with the Lion Halslabel with the years 1950 to 1966 (in the worst case, ""only"" 12 years old). Everyone is allowed to figure out for themselves how the distribution of the vintages looked. In any case, there can not have been a ""solera procedure"" in which everything was poured together and then allowed to lie again. I\'ve tried the normal 10 times and everyone tasted different (thanks Mara). Not all were really good. So far we are talking about 20,400 bottles.\nIn the 3600 remaining bottles we speak of a Bowmore distilled in 1964 and after at least 14 years 1979 in the bottle of the same design came, just with the neck label 1964, instead of the Lion.

There he had two favorite activities: shooting rats with a gun and walking to the railway to listen to the freight trains arrive... so I was distracted. So. While I was sharing associations, the drink was transformed. Recognizable notes of paraffin, wax, honey combs, apple jam came out, but this is the kind of jam that was prepared on a fire, because the smoke feels great. The drink becomes sweeter, thicker. Here are the dujes pears. In the open glass, the industrial notes and smoke completely receded, giving way to the sweetness of yellow fruits. If I cover it with a lid and let it stand, then I find myself at the railway station again… How many good films in which the station played a significant role: from the bear in ""Paddington"" to ""Once upon a Time in America"" and ""Carlito\'s Way"", ""Some like it hot""and many others.

Many good reviews are published on the dram already so I can skip the aromas and flavours description and rather focus on the overall tasting enjoyment instead - and that is flabbergasting! Great stuff from the past and certainly worth heavy bucks, how many depends solely on the deepness of your pockets. A perfect pick for Christmas night!\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is deep copper and the nose offers exactly this adorable mix of peaty, malty, sherried and wooden aromas old Ardbeg are so famous for. Dozens of different impressions float my olfactory cells with none of them trying to be dominant - and most aromas rather belong to the old whisky styles (not wood/cask-driven but spirit/peat-induced). A nose that can be explored for hours and it is a great pleasure to do so. After significant time of breathing (more than 30 minutes) the interesting peaty-medicinal notes grow stronger while the sherry aromas retreat somewhat - but the balance is kept all the time.\nTaste\n96\n96\nThe taste is multi-multi layered with an unbelievably rich profile of different flavours and all in perfect harmony. Again, this is not cask-driven like most of the modern drams but the cask did an excellent job in enriching and supporting the maturation of the spirit. This is a must-chewer and I suggest to keep it in the mouth as long as you can resist the reflex to swallow it. It offers new impressions all the time and none of them are disappointing, actually I enjoy every single one very much.\nFinish\n95\n95\nThe initial mouthfeel is very satisfying with a warming and creamy texture coating all of the mouth very quickly. No distracting bitter or drying moments neither in the arrival nor during the finish. That is very long and it vanishes in slowly fading waves which focus on different aspects of the taste again. A dram which can be savoured for hours because I need another small sip only for a new kick of long lasting impressions. Great stuff to quaff! Water smooths the dram but like so often the different layers intermingle now so I suggest to explore this dram neat first before experimenting with any reduction.

With water: the same but it's easier to pick up the charry, sherried oak now, and some chocolate appears. Oddly, for about 5-10 minutes after adding water, it smells strongly like a tire fire. Perhaps an artifact of this dram being from a bottle that has been open an unknown amount of years.\nTaste\nAbsurdly good body. Amply giving and rounded, with glorious levels of biting, all-encompassing peat and old sherry. A fair amount of drying tannins and strong char.

At full strength, dark chocolate is filled with cherry brandy and infused with tarry peat smoke. Marzipan, toffee and vanilla mingle with rum and raisin ice cream; then the sweetness is sliced through by pungent black peppercorns, fennel and the salty-balsamic complexity of menthol, pine resin and sea spray.  Barbequed bananas, cinnamon-spiced pears and caramalised walnuts bring sizzling warmth and deep maturity. With water, waves of classic Ardbeg notes energe, fused with juicy malt, luscious fruits and oily nuts: tarry ropes, briny sea-salt and fresh zesty limes battle it out against blueberry pie, spiced plum skins and weighty crushed sultanas. Creamy honey, treacle toffee and hazelnuts collide with pinesap, cedar and iodine. Espresso and cream simmers in the background.\n\nTaste: Rich and oily with an intense burst of smoked berry fruits, treacle and juicy malt. The taste is initially deep and powerful as an avalanche of mouthwatering baked blueberry pie, dried apricots, dates and plums deepens and rolls over the tongue, drizzled with treacle and a sprinkling of peaty-demerara sugar. A mouthful of Macchiato coffee and clotted cream rises to a cresendo bringing a robust and earthy warmth, before a wave of briny-iodine, powdery violets and walnut oil freshens then dries the palate with lingering tarry espresso.\n\nFinish: Long, spiced, oily and salty with spiced blueberry, treacle, sun-dried raisins and walnut oil.', ""yes!

I can’t thank my friend enough for these samples, it’s been eye opening and a crucial part of my whisky journey. Sláinte.\n\nSo what’s the takeaway? Modern Bowmore may as well be a different distillery compared to this sample, which apparently tastes like hyper fruity Tomatin, in my limited experience. A blenders glass is a worthy investment to enhance the nose on some drams. Bowmore makes the best mangoes. Most importantly, whisky is best shared with friends; near, far or imaginary.\nNose\n95\n95\nMy first thought goes to Tomatin, and not Islay. Extraordinarily fruity. All the fruits. In this order: Pressed mango and mango skin (how it’s slightly sappy), fresh guava juice, lychee jelly cups my Asian friends gave me as a kid, passion fruit concentrate, perfect honeydew. Those are the dominant fruits but oh, there’s so much more. Kiwi, mirabelle, cotton candy grapes... Toss all that with perfect mint. I love mint, and even more in whisky and this just is beautiful harmony of mint and fruit. No peat, at least it’s not here yet. It demands to be compared, so a 73 Speyside (118356) enters the fray, which I’ll tell you is no slouch, but it’s more on honey/mint and cannot touch the tropical aspects. I’m afraid half of this will evaporate up my nose. I’m drinking this in a 1920’s blenders glass and also a glencairn and it needs to be mentioned how helpful the blenders glass is. You get much more out of the nose. It’s 25% more expressive if I had to quantify it. 95/100.\nTaste\n94\n94\nSlightly waxy on arrival, but only slightly. It’s not thin, but it’s also not heavy on the palate. It’s fresh. Unbelievably fresh. Mint is up here with a little resin, keeping the mango at bay before it takes over. The 73 Speyside is waxy, honeyed and fat; while this is quenching and precise. Apples to oranges. Both top notch. The 1976 Tomatin has the same quenching fruits, while not quite as impressive, it’s the closest I’ve come. Seriously even mangoes aren’t as mango-y. 94/100.\nFinish\n97\n97\nTo say fruity is just a blatant understatement. Quenching, concentrated tropical fruits. Sharp. So fresh! How is this 40 years old? A crescendo of mango that is frankly embarrassing. A mango lassie, hold the yogurt. So bloody long too. The best three chews of juicy fruit gum. The mango just dominates and that’s more than ok. It grows in the finish for almost a minute and then it hangs around a little less than forever. Only slightly minty now. I really don’t get peat - any. Honestly the closest whisky I’ve had to this is a 1976 Tomatin (84338), but that one doesn’t quite have the depth or harmony. Let’s test that memory, since this sample in itself is a special occasion, the 76 Tomatin enters the party. Yes! We are in the same ballpark! I’ll tell you these are not that dissimilar. No, in fact they are very similar. This was the most astounding display of mango I’ve ever had. Amazing. 97/100.', '[April, 2018]  Sadly, a loved one passed away this night (R.I.P.) and the best way to salute a deceased person is to have his/her favourite dram while remembering all the good times we shared.

These drams are for all faithfully departed!\nNose\n97\n97\nThe colour is auburn (which is very dark for a bourbon cask maturation) and the texture shows many small tears that slowly consolidate and build slow legs. The nose is a miracle in itself: I guess it is easier to tell the fruits that are NOT in there than the other way around. It is fresh and bold and one of the most complex I encountered so far (not just fruits, there are hints of peat smoke, spices and herbs too among many other aromas).\nTaste\n96\n96\nThe taste is truly multi-layered on all these delicious fruits with barley sugars and honeys, spicy wooden notes, fine peaty-smoky flavours and some maritime aromas. You can chew this dram forever and still you will find something new. Water is not needed (it is a sacrilege to dilute this dram)!\nFinish\n97\n97\nThe dram arrives very charming in the mouth and instantly coats the whole of it with a creamy and slightly peppery feeling. Despite the 40 years in an oak cask there are no bitter tannins or astringent moments at all. The finish is very long and extends this beautiful taste into eternity. No distracting moments, all is in perfect balance and harmony. Some more spices pop up while all the fruits stay as strong as they were in the first taste.

I scored it 91 points on the day.\n\nThis is definitely my last of the night, so much epic-ness! First impressions: this is a firm, straight-forward malt whisky and no messing, sharing similar traits to the Glen Albyn as well as the Coleburn & Convalmore. All are bottled at strength, all old boys [though this is the oldest by bottling year], and all solid/robust in style with a deeper/more subtle-complex undercurrent - which is why I brought them home for more considered contemplation.\n\nN: Bitter<sweet complex of rum, molasses, ginger, corn syrup, maple syrup, cognac, prune syrup, fresh figs, dried figs,… Sure its sweet, but not overly so. Thats helped by an oat biscuit base, lime-coconut, [sweet] grapefruit, granola, honeyed cornflakes,... ok, its sweet - a controlled sweet with a sweet-savoury/citrus base.\nT: Beautiful arrival, just so, clean, slick body and opening out all flower-like and leading onto a slick chew. Doesnt do a great deal [just yet] but those sugars are engagingly tasty. That sweet-complex never gets too out of hand, though theres certainly a Jalebi stickiness to it - the sweet grapefruit citrus helping to balance things. A serene calm right now but the cogs are turning.\nF: After a heathery slick and beautiful oaked cereals, it finishes impeccably with a gentle sweet vanilla-barley spirit coupled with that now firmly established [sherried] old-skool sugar-oak complex,......... hold on,.. it hasnt nearly finished yet,.....\nC: I didnt quite manage to take in just how beautiful, impeccable & flawless this was at the show, given the nature of things at public events.

Nose: deep, complex. Apricots, blackberries, peonies, brooms, black licorice, figs, dates, scents of tropical plants and cherries in brandy: each of these notes combine to draw a particular picture complex and lush of this very venerable Glen Grant. The nose evolves with minerality (shale, manganese) on grilled walnuts, quince jelly and tobacco. Palate: lively, racy. Its attack oscillates between exotic fruits, ripe fruit jellies, liquorice stick and noble spices (cardamom, clove, cinnamon). The mid-palate makes us enjoy a delicious blend of sandalwood, pipe tobacco and red fruits (raspberry, strawberry). Juicy, it extends on citrus (orange, clementine). Final: long, silky. The finesse of its tannins communicates to his touch a lot of delicacy and velvety. Its invigorating acidity suggests hints of mustard seeds and cherries in eau-de-vie.

This combines the best ""dirty"" Springbank profile with delicious impressions of peat to create an interesting and very quaffable dram. As this bottle is way too expensive these days (because of collectors and investors) here is a dram which comes close to this profile for affordable bucks (WB id 54323), not kidding! I just had the two side by side and yes, this Longrow is better (more complex) but the Ardmore really provides a profile which is pretty close to that (according to my taste buds, only).\nNose\n94\n94\nThe colour is old gold and the nose offers an excellent old-style peated profile with all the interesting ""dirty"" Springbank aromas present (e.g., machine oils, farmyard, waxes, bonfire ashes) beside delicious fruits, honeys and spices. This is an excellent nose, I could sniff this for hours.\nTaste\n93\n93\nThe taste is nicely layered on sweet (fruits, honeys, barley sugars) and bitter (peat, bonfire ashes, waxes) flavours in an interesting back-and-forth of impressions.

No, I did not buy these expensive bottles as their price is simply absurd for a drinker (not sure if it is justified for a collector or investor either, but that is another story).  So I just bought a sample of this methusalem dram...     \n\nThe colour is tawny and the texture shows a fat sticky ring that builds medium tears with very slow legs (a fine oiliness, for sure).  The nose needs quite some time to fully enfold but then it offers an adorable old school sherry profile of the finest kind.  All the different sherry-induced aromas are there in a balanced combination with the maltiness of the Mortlach spirit and the spices from the wood.  This is sherry maturation at its best - not too dominant (despite 58 years in the cask), truly complex and without any single off-note.  Simply a perfect cask, well done G&M!  It arrives charming and nicely coating in the mouth with just a minor adstringent feeling from the tannins (actually, this is neglectable for a 58-years old dram).  The taste is layered and chewable, it offers dozens of different flavours in a close-to-perfection harmony if you chew it long enough.  Again not a single flaw that I can detect.  The finish is long and adds even more (dark) chocolatey flavours that are very delicious.  No bitter or adstringent moments here, the wood is just about right.  Some water flattens the nose (very unusual) but smoothes and enriches both the taste and finish without increasing the bitter tannic side of the sherry maturation (what often happens with heavily sherried drams).  So I like to nose it neat and prefer to drink it a little reduced (what is fine as this increases the yield of the sample).\n\nThis is a great old school sherry maturation, something that probably is lost forever due to the different practices and targets of both the sherry bodegas and the whisky industry today.  A delicious dram and if you can afford it, go for it (depending on your pockets buy a sample or a bottle).   As a drinker I am willing to pay up to 500 Euro for a bottle of this quality (you could buy such bottles for even less bucks not long ago, but unfortunately these times are gone, too)...\n\nPS:  By the way, this bottling was done from a first fill sherry butt no. 494 that yielded 347 bottles (according to G&M).

Already matured for three decades, the whisky in this refill butt was kept at its natural strength.\n\nWhen it reached 35 years of age in 2011 it was assessed again, and a conscious decision was made to allow the whisky to continue to mature and develop character.

Laphroaig 1981,93.88,148,"[""The key data of this Laphroaig alone - distilled in 1981 and aged in Oloroso sherry barrels for 27 years - are impressive. I am particularly curious to see how complex it is compared to the 25-year-old Laphroaig with bourbon and 2nd fill Oloroso maturation and the 33-year-old bottling from 1987 - and how much smoke is left after 27 years.\n\nRegardless of the complexity, I find the current price of € 7,000 already adventurous.\nNose\n94\n94\nBy far the darkest Laphroaig I've had - both in color and in aroma. Slow, oily legs roll along the glass wall.\n\nImmediately after pouring, a heavy and aromatic cloud of smoke spreads in the glass. It is not about the young, impetuous smoke that pulls the tears from your eyes, but about a smoke that has already been clearly broken down.\n\nThis smoke is initially complemented by bitter and slightly rotten wood notes, which gives the aroma a very dignified character. Especially in the initial phase, these rustic notes tend to dominate. Leather and tobacco also come to mind.\n\nOver time, the Oloroso barrel becomes more and more noticeable in the form of plum jam, forest honey and very ripe, dark fruits and a little petroleum. In addition, the smoke moves into the background and more filigree and maritime notes are revealed. The combination of dark fruits, rotten wood and maritime character reminds me in parts of the Clynelish 1995 (barrel no. 11230) from Signatory.\n\nThe 56.6% vol., Which is quite high for this age, is excellently integrated and at most has a slightly cooling effect on the nose.\nTaste\n94\n94\nThe start is strong and spicy, the smoke is more noticeable from the start.

Hey, sorry, I was a little bit excited when I was drinking Lagavulin 21. I thought it was the representative of medicinal wine. Now comparing it, I found that the former is more like sugared chaihu granules. It ’s hard currency.\nNose\nThe pour alcohol smells fragrant, and the camphor pills are a bit refreshing.

Dry in the middle, similar to the limestone and chalk ash commonly found in Caol ila, but fortunately, the characteristics of sherry barrels are added, black coffee such as American coffee, naturally dried plums, and brandy extracted blackthorn. There is neither the intensity of the initial filling of the barrel, nor the lusciousness of refilling the barrel. At first glance, it is feminine, but it has the richness of tar, leather, rubber, and oil. In the end, the woody aroma is relatively dull, like old wooden boards that have been soaked in seawater for years, licorice, and crushed mint leaves with more phytoalkali.

This full cocoa, a long tail with a bit of fruit acidity, and a slight fruity flavor floating on it, are you sure I'm not holding a glass of cold hand? The effect of high-year oak can be clearly felt, but rather than woody taste, it is better to remove the sweetness of Lagavulin's ginseng, plus a lot of licorice and over-carbonized coffee beans.

Longrow 1973,93.88,44,"[""This is a type of old sherried whisky that you don't find anymore.

Well, Shirley was given a muscle strengthening shot (peat). Hunan bacon, library, burning incense (this taste must be high), dried bamboo shoots, by the way, his aroma is very elegant, not low expressiveness. Fortunately, I didn\'t drink it in a noisy environment. The balance is a perfect score. It would be great if there was a bottle of perfume with this taste, the orphan of Serge Lutens?\n\nDrink: The body is flexible, the skeleton is strong, the peat smoke is more expressive in the mouth, the end rhyme is very long, and it is extremely comfortable. I can only describe it up to this point. When the scent fusion degree is high, it is difficult and unconcerned to entangle the taste.\n\nOverall: I have always liked Longrow. This bottle is rich, elegant, ethereal and balanced.', 'It stands at the top of sherried longrow. Extremely soft but full bodied and elegant.

It's well balanced and doesn't get tannic towards the finale. Waiting gives you and extra layer of soft, moist wood. \nFinish\nIn the finish, this whisky gets increasingly peaty.

Nice stuff to quaff, but in doubt I would rather go for other sherried Ardbeg releases (e.g., the legendary dark and pale oloroso 1967 vintages).\nNose\n90\n90\nThe colour is burnished and the nose is a little reserved first, it seems as if the sherry contains most of the powerful Ardbeg aromas of naked 1972 vintages. This is not really a problem, the dram just takes its time to enfold and I suggest to wait at least 20 minutes (better more). After that an interesting mix of both strong sherry and peat aromas is joined by rather shy fruit and wooden notes. This is pretty nice, no doubt - but to be honest: I prefer both the more powerful naked (meaning unsherried) 70ies Ardbeg and the more complex sherried 60ies Ardbeg bottlings. Sounds decadent? Maybe, but it is as it is...\nTaste\n94\n94\nThe taste is more interesting as the powerful malt-induced Ardbeg flavours dare to enter the spotlight right from the beginning. This is an interesting mix of sweet winey, bitter peaty, sweet malty and bitter wooden impressions in a back-and-forth procession along my taste buds. The different layers are not clearly separated but this does not harm the great tasting experience. Yes, this is Ardbeg at its best!\nFinish\n93\n93\nThe dram arrives warming and coating on my palate without distracting moments. The finish is long (what else?) and adds more of the dark chocolatey and bitter ashy impressions without getting unbalanced.

A lot of vivacity (tangerines, orange marmalade) but also a very spectacular ‘thickness’ (concentrated fruits).

Outstanding Mortlach!!', ""[July, 2019] A dear one peacefully passed away (R.I.P. Bernard) and so I open this bottle of (almost) his vintage to have a toast on him and all the others that are gone already (he was not into whisky - otherwise I would have shared this dram with him earlier). This one was bottled in the eighties (or earlier) so the mysterious bottle maturation had more than three decades to improve this dram further...\n\n...and obviously, it did! This is more than an adequate dram to all faithfully departed - it seems it was made in heaven itself, actually. What a great drink of the past when everything at every distillery was still made by hand, the stills were heated by direct fires below them (and no one exploded, while the modern stills blow off at the click of a digital camera - according to the ridiculous rigmarole of the tour guides). Oooh, how would I love to have a time machine to go back to 1936 and have a chat with the men while they distil this perfect dram...\n\n[June, 2021] I re-tasted this dram tonight after a great football match and fully confirm my old review and score. Dream stuff for perfect nights.\nNose\n96\n96\nThe colour is quite dark at auburn and I use a big spherical blender's glass to nose this old gem (never drink out of these glasses, they are for nosing purposes only). Even at the first sniff this nose offers an almost unbelievably complex and balanced profile of both the finest old style sherry-induced aromas and the bold malt characteristics Mortlach is famous for. After some minutes of breathing in the big blender's glass all these aromas virtually explode and form a hard to describe sensory experience. By the way, the wood is rather shy (as it should be according to the old wise whisky men of this time) and leaves all the stage for the malt and wine flavours. But it generously provides a firm backbone every aroma can hold on - to be not pushed away by the others. While the sherry aromas dominate the first nosing impressions the malt-driven flavours grow stronger over time as if this whisky will offer all of its beautiful components one after the other in a victory parade. Hey, this is one of the finest noses I ever came across (I state this with a rather larger dram measure in the big blender's glass and after around 30 minutes of breathing time) and it still improves with more breathing time (now more than three hours).\nTaste\n96\n96\nThe taste is multi-layered and greatly chewable. It offers a perfect combo of sherry- and malt-induced flavours without any single off-note or imbalance. All starts with bitter-sour winey impressions but very soon the barley sugars kick in and start a sweet counter-attack. The sherry sends in the leather troops while the malt is supported by delicious fruits and summer floral notes. This battle rages on from layer to layer - with herbal-earthy arms on the sherry's side and honey-waxy defenders of the sweet positions. Nutty, grassy, oily, toffee and spicy support troops are sent into this fight one after the other but no side gains any advantage - all stays in perfect balance and harmony. Finally, they agree on a cease fire and all join in a grand chocolatey finale that simply is ... delicious.\nFinish\n95\n95\nThe dram arrives absolutely charming on the palate and covers the whole of the mouth with a warm and creamy coating. There are some minor bitter-astringent moments but these are not distracting at all (and hey, this dram slept about 40 to 50 years in its wooden home). The finish is long but it is not able to add significant new impressions as all combatants have used all their resources during the tasting fights already. But it extends this tasty experience until the dram slowly vanishes in several fading waves, without any distracting moments at all. Water releases even more aromas in the nose (I never thought this was possible) and it strengthens the sherry flavours in both taste and finish. It is worthwhile to play around a little with water even with this low-proof dram - in does not flatten out because the aromas and flavours are bold and strong enough to withstand a minor reduction. Actually, I like it both neat and somewhat reduced.""]",WB135040,Single Malt,Mortlach,,,,40.0 % Vol.,750 ml,8,"['ARDBERG', 'grinface', 'Port', 'mudshark', 'dram-drinker', 'Baanaanaabob', 'Beccis', 'hs305']","['96', '92', '95', '95', '93', '95', '97', '96']"

The nose reminds me a lot of my beloved 1960 release I of the Family Casks. It's simply perfume made of maturing for six decades in the most precious sherry wood. Overall, it's an amazing whisky, with a quite unique aroma and flavours, which have developed during this extremely long maturation. That is liquid history and a privilege I could taste it.\nNose\nFirst you have resin from old precious wood and pine needles with a bit of wet humus. Then more earthy sherry with dried fruits, such as sultanas, figs, dates, prunes, cherries and a bit of mango. Later some dark forest honey. It's a very vibrant, majestic and fresh nose.\nTaste\nThe taste is unexpected fresh and fruity, half sweet and half dry, on a base of earthy sherry tones. So you have various fruits, such as grapefruit, red grapes and raspberries. It's a mix between citrus and red fruits, more fresh than dried. The earthy notes are liquorice, Coca-Cola, humus and wet forest floor, with a bit of burnt sugar aside. Yes, this dram is hugely complex and very well balanced between the fruits and earthy flavours. More delicate than a sherry monster.\nFinish\nThe finish is long, again with earthy sherry and the citrusy notes.

Aging in sherry cask in what it has more succeeded. Marked by prune, cherry brandy, shimmering spices, pinch of salt and notes of precious wood. It also refers to dates, blood orange and leather. It evolves on red fruits and zan. Palate : huge, exceptionally rich. A light, slightly burnt woody layer is covered with luscious notes of wild strawberry and dark chocolate.

Nose: starts all on these very typical half-medicinal, half-mineral notes that are to be found in these old Longrows – as well as in the 1987s. A lot of gunpowder (but not quite sulphur as such), artichokes, bitter oranges, antiseptic, hints of new plastic pouch, wet gravel, putty, wet earth, seaweed, rusted iron, bandages, paraffin, horse dung, manure… Very unusual, very ‘Longrow’ and quite extreme.

Mouth (neat): just the first second is a tad wobbly or shaky (because of these slightly plastic-like or chemical notes that are really unusual) but then it’s all a wonderful development, mildly peaty, fantastically earthy, with these slightly rotten notes that are so fantastically nicer than they sound (I guess I’ll have to find another word next time). Bitter oranges, game (a lot), kippers, lime, beeswax, cinchona, ginger tonic, artichoke liqueur (do you know Cynar?), Jaegermeister, salted liquorice… What a beast! Good medium power, easily drinkable without water but still, let’s check what happens. With water: the peat stands out and it's beautiful. It’s got something of an old style Caol Ila at this stage. Finish: long, saltier, peaty, clean, with touches of Cynar and earth back in the aftertaste. Comments: this make is monstrously unusual.

Slightly woody sweetness Stubborn strawberry jam, chocolate, roasted coffee acidity, accumulation lasts for as long as you drink. Summary: From the stage of pouring, the presence of overwhelming fragrance, sweet and elegant fragrance fills the room. Personally, it is one of the sherry barrel maturation completion system. There is a similar flavor in the 18th year of Clear Danpie of the special grade period, but because of the cask strength, the balance is dependent on taste. Both are very nice bottles. Also, if you drink carefully, it is interesting that Sherry seems to have a similar tendency in the 12 years of Green Danpie, which is not dominant. Whether this miraculous Sherry feel comes from, barrels or alcoholic beverages, as far as the official of the past is seen it can be said to be alcoholic, but at the same 72, 71 there are also bottles which this flavor has not appeared in barrels, and sake Should I look at the combination of quality and barrels ... Anyway, as a drinker I want to drink while I can drink, a very nice bottle. Sherry malt having sensual and glossy sweetness, fruity feeling can hardly be found except for part of Dronac 1971, 1972 vintage.

I’ve tried quite a few vintages from 1946 to 1963, all ex-sherry wood, but I had kept the 1960 for this special occasion. Now’s the time. Colour: dark amber. Nose: both the resemblance and the differences are striking. Did they use to add a bit of rum into Macallan at CH&K? Of course I’m joking, what’s similar is the ‘old humidor’ side as well as the dried fruits, while what’s obviously different is the slightly steely profile, the whiffs of roasted malt, the notes of toasted cake and the chocolate. Also the wood smoke that arises after one minute. More globally, this is obviously drier; I’d even say it’s both drier and less emphatic than many other vintages. The raisins have been burnt here. Mouth: wider, fuller and more ‘immediate’ than the rum, and without any noticeable oakiness. It’s typically old Macallan, in fact, with this sherry that does not taste like plain sherry at all, and that brings many dried fruits, from figs to raisins and from dates to prunes. No meatiness here, no gunpowder, no grapey notes, rather those fruits plus some tobacco, some fresh fruits as well (ripe bananas, perhaps) and then just one drop of cough syrup that brings even more complexity (a little wormwood, aniseed, mint, sloe, juniper…) Impeccable. Finish: long, rather round, with some chocolate, marmalade, maybe cherries in kirsch, figs… Fresh oranges in the aftertaste lift it.

After pouring, you can immediately see that the whisky in the left glass is a shade lighter. Which does not change the fact that both are relatively clear. Certainly it has nothing to do with the currently fashionable color :)\nIn the right glass the smell is definitely more volatile. I would even say that the left one seems muffled at first. At first contact, red fruits and marine climates loom in both. Definitely dignified and deep.\n\nNOS: 50.4% Ripe Red Fruit, Seafood Sauce, Mint? citrus? (a feeling of pleasant refreshment on the nose). The sweetness mixes with the sea, every now and then revealing a ripe apple peel to take us over the sea breeze, to visit the orchard again with a plate full of mussels, herbs and citrus. Definitely pleasant, though delicate, unobtrusive. You can say dignified :) Cherry syrup with the addition of herbs. Insane. An hour has passed.\nIn the meantime, there are constant comparisons to the 53.6% version. The smell hits a few (teen?) centimeters from the glass. It is powerful, full and round. Everything in the left glass, but stronger, more specific (cleaner and dirtier at the same time!?). Ripe red fruits, warmed up on the hottest summer day, a fishing boat filled with fresh seafood passes by. Where does this dried (?) plum smell come from? They must have been left in the pocket of a leather jacket. On such a warm day there must be something refreshing - lemon zest, grapefruit pulp fit perfectly. A cherry, maybe a cherry stone?\nDespite 20 minutes of continuous sniffing, the minerality/smokyness does not disappear, what's more, it changes: it's fishy, then fishy, sea, salty, mineral. At no point did you tar.\nI go back to the left glass (50.4%) - definitely more delicate, you have to stick your nose deeper into the glass. However, this does not change the fact that the fragrance is incredibly dignified and deep. Really a lot of sweetness, but this citrus counter perfectly balances it. There are also flashes of leather and nuts. In an empty glass, prunes, cherries in chocolate, leather.\n53.6% - there are also caramel aromas, sweet candies. Amazing whisky.\n\nTaste: 50.4% - light fruitiness quickly gives way to dried notes, bitter cocoa, to return to red fruit (prune), cherries. Delicate minerality. Grapefruit peel.\n53.6% - no words. The flavor definitely perpetuates what is in the nose. Red fruits, sweetness, seainess, seafood, slight tartness. Sweetness, menthol... Tartness can be a disadvantage, but certainly not here - it beautifully counters the sweetness and smokiness, combining in a joint dance - the finish.\n\nFinish: 50.4% - long, drying, dry. Slightly mineral, the nuance of the taste remains - red fruit.\n53.6% - long, delicate tartness. Delicately dry, you can feel unspecified red fruits, sweetness and a slight smokiness (more dried fruit?).\n\nTo sum up: The 53.6% version is better in every aspect and just as 50.4% is a brilliant whisky, which seems to be every whisky enthusiast's dream, so 53.6% is a godsend.

Balvenie 1962,93.75,22,"[""We could compare this whisky to an old wise, discreet and erudite who likes to talk a lot when asked a question. This dram full of history can not leave indifferent. Time has made a real goldsmith work on this Balvenie: 50 years of aging and still a lot of character, complexity and power. A great whisky, atypical, not easy to identify, but with nice surprises.\nNose\nthe first impression is that of a block of aromas indissociable from each other, given the perfect homogeneity of this whisky. There is no doubt, the weather has done its job. Nothing exceeds, everything is melted. It will not be easy to unravel all that. In general, the whole is soft and silky, delicate. The first aromas that stand out are fruity, rather exotic: mango, pineapple, papaya, banana. Vanilla and honey let us think that this whisky has aged in bourbon casks. Well, we are completely wrong! It is a barrel of sherry that served to the aging of this malt. The nose is of rare wealth. All the aroma families pass through it. Underlying floral notes are very pleasant: jasmine, rose, violet, hibiscus. Chocolate, raisins and frangipane remind us of the sherry cask, while at the same time, mint, raspberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, cinnamon and pistachio make us travel to another world. It's completely bluffing. A multitude of aromas in this tiny centilitre of whisky is almost magical.\nTaste\njust like the first impression on the nose, the texture is very soft and silky, almost creamy. It's warm and comforting. We want to drink this dram by the fire. Despite the age and low alcohol level, this 50-year-old Balvenie has kept a good dose of vigor, even if it's not a powerhouse. He has body, but everything is in delicacy. Exotic fruits are always present, as are red fruits, with notes of raspberry jam with mint. Vanilla and honey go well with chocolate, cinnamon and exotic fruits. The floral side is also very present, especially with jasmine and hibiscus. The whole is very greedy. Once again, the nature of the cask becomes anecdotal, as the aromatic palette is extended.\nFinish\nStrong enough, on jasmine, hibiscus, cinnamon and exotic fruits, but unfortunately, the whole does not stay very long in the mouth."", 'Dress: Or- straw, some orange highlights Nose: Inimitable, unique, a bouquet of flowers, roses, jasmine, violet, lavender, hallucinating! Nothing to do with Balvenie 70\'s often exotic and waxy character. We are in something never felt before! Even more surprising when David Stewart informs you that this is a sherry refill! Palate: The slap! Once again it\'s a unique sensation! The 50 years is one of those whiskys we say one day ""wow, I have never tasted such, I have no references to make, it\'s unique."" The mouth remains in continuity nose, an infusion of flowers! We find again the rose, the jasmine, always the purple very present (but not that of the Bowmore years we do not like, do not worry.) The hibiscus and lavender also point their nose, the texture is syrupy, and what is also surprising is the almost total absence of bitterness, woody, or other ... By cons what impresses is its very sweet character! mouth in the mouth there is an explosion of sugar with these flowers as finally petals of crystallized roses. Final: Of an improbable length! Fresh. And what remains mostly is the violet! A lot of violets! The impression of having eaten one of these candies with violet. Exceptional! Conclusion: This Balvenie from 1962 bottled in 2012 and which pays homage to 50 years of work at WG & S David Stewart is simply a nugget! So yes, the nuggets are worth it.

These old Springbank are always excellent, I never a sub-standard one (at least I cannot remember it). Given both nose and taste I doubt this was a sherry cask. I think this was a first fill bourbon cask with maybe one or two sherry staves build in - a practice which was quite common in the old times when coopers simply used to staves at hand to repair or resize casks, not caring about purity (like ""bourbon only"" or ""sherry only""). Why should they? The whisky went all into blends anyway - they would have laughed if someone had asked for a ""single cask bottling"". Times have changed significantly since then...\nNose\n93\n93\nThe colour is russetmuscat and the nose offers a subtle and complex floral-honeyed profile with lots of summer flowers, different types of honey and waxes, spices and earthy aromas. I do not find any sherry aromas in here (because other connoisseurs stated a sherry cask maturation), even after longer breathing. This smells more like a first fill bourbon cask which can generate a very dark dram too (after twenty years). Great nose, no doubt.\nTaste\n94\n94\nThe taste is multi-layered on florals, honeys, resins, chalk, machine oils, tobacco, leather, liquorice and and and...

Water flattens the dram and strengthens the bitter flavours only, I prefer it neat.\nFinish\n89\n89\nThe initial mouthfeel is warming and instantly coating with some bitter astringent moments (the tannins of the wood are quite strong, which supports my guess of a first fill bourbon cask - a first fill sherry cask would certainly taste different).

Much more oomph… A tropical fruit salad with the noblest spices and a little seawater sprinkled all over it. Excuse me, but that’ll do.

Taking stock of the situation, I thought screw it, let's try this Provenance I've had on my bucket list for ages and then let the door close behind me one last time.\n\nSo... what is it?

This has some similarities to the 1975-2000 43% bottling (92 pts.), but I'll be damned if these herbal, salty, marine touches don't give this one an edge over it. This is not a particularly complex malt, but this bouquet is certainly unique. I don't remember another one exactly like this.\nTaste\nKelpy, marine peat, lots of white pepper, seashells. The peat keeps getting louder the longer I hold it on my tongue. It never becomes harsh, but certainly burning. Chamois and ripe cantaloupes. Some wax too. Medium salt, strong peat, and sea air.

Colour: full gold. Nose: starts rather simply, on full smoke, peat and cooked apple. As often with these stunning Ardbegs, it needs a few seconds before it bursts into your nose… And here it goes: musk, ginger, sea air, iodine, wax polish, cooked apricots, old turpentine, old furniture, bandages, camphor… Need I say more? Even better than last time – this bottle was opened more than one year ago and was 2/3 empty. Incredible, it became even more complex! But wait, maybe the palate is a bit tired… Mouth: now it’s very quick in action! Smoky, peppery, gingery, very creamy and even sort of silky. Lots of Lapsang Souchong tea, grapefruit juice, dark chocolate… Also something a little ‘burnt’ (burnt cake, BBQ herbs, curry powder)… Not monstrously complex but extremely bold and balanced at the same time, with kind of a roughness that’s most enjoyable. The finish is ‘long like a day without bread’, peppery and spicy, with also some clove and quite some tannins. In short, still a total winner and a landmark bottling. 95 points.

Orange cake, a Turkish delight shop in Istanbul, various pieces of precious woods, warm cellulose, many leaves, a little chamomile, a little blond tobacco, a drop of mint essence… In truth, it’s slightly shy after the 1974 and the 1966, and would never quite open itself, but water should help. With water: still a little shy, perhaps, and it’s rather wood essences that come out. Other than that, more of the same. Mouth (neat): there might be a little too much oak, but all the rest is of the highest order. Rosewater, litchis, old gewürztraminer, teas, cardamom cake, acorn squash, pumpkin pips, these sorts of things. Not quite sure it’s too oaky, as we’re wandering around the limits of oakiness. With water: no. Yes! Not quite. Yes. Not sure… That often happens with older whiskies, they are flirting with your senses and sometimes they just lose you. Naughty babies! Finish: medium, perhaps a little drying. That’s right, a little flat and oaky. Comments: the problem is that we had just tried some stunners, so this old baby’s having trouble striking a chord at this point.

Now, of course there is something more to see than the mango, the passion fruit, the papaya, the pineapple and the grapefruit. On the nose I also had blossoms, chamomile and butter.

Pink sea salt, waxy lemon rind and many touches of camphor, brine and even more menthol touches like eucalyptus oils and mint tea. Given a little time the fruits emerge: passion fruit, papaya, mango, pineapple. Almost quivers with this gelatinous mix of fruits and beautifully delicate peat smoke. A harmonious, deeply complex and almost poetically beautiful nose that feels pristinely structured, poised and in total control of itself. With water: seawater mixed with limoncello, salted liquorice, beeswax, hessian, vapour rubs and globally drier, leaner and more ruthlessly precise. Mouth: wonderful attack, all on nervous, brittle coastal and saline complexities. Dried seaweed, ink, aged tar liqueurs, bundled dried herbs and mineral oil. The fruits are here too but they feel waxier, dried out and rather desiccated, things like banana chips, dried mango chunks and passion fruit seeds. The peat is oily, tarry and drying with this rather waspish smokiness. Could be anywhere from 15 - 35 years old in some ways, there’s this ethereal ‘out of time’ feel about it. With water: gah! Just astonishing power, richness of smoke, deeper peat notes, a broader, sparser fruitiness and the impression of many exotic teas. Some lighter wood spice and white pepper notes too. Finish: luminous, endless, impeccably saline, citric, inky, herbal, lightly tarry and delivering all these silky smoky and mineral notes.

Very slightly oaky (more present on the palate after longer time in the mouth).

Oily and creamy, very sweet like a dessert with caramel or rum cake. Not exactly that complex, but it has it's moments. Not more complex than the 25yo bottling according to my palate, but rather just sweeter. I expected it to be a bit more balanced as well, but the sherry presence here is alot indeed.\nFinish\nRather medium.

Sherry is the orthodox sherry flavor, and Taliscar is rarely released now, but the age of the wine is not low, so although the alcohol content and oil are fine, the flavor is not pleasant. It has certain archaeological significance, but it is better to go after Laodao Wine.\nNose\nThe Taliska peat of the pre-fire smells particularly comfortable. Compared with the modern peppery ocean yellow fruit, the old wine has a particularly strong herbal flavor, which may be related to the long-term bottle aging, with a faint floral aroma, soap bubbles, and paper ash , Tobacco, as a whole belongs to the low ppm category. There is a lot of sugar, dragon fruit, lychee, honey, some melons and fruits with very light taste, compared with the fresh smell of toothpaste and salt water. The end turns to depression, old books, pepper, longan, mocha, dried dates, wooden table.\nTaste\nPeat is not very friendly, like eating a big mouthful of toothpaste, charcoal fire, flue-cured tobacco, pepper, mint, plant callus juice, slightly salty, but not too marine, salt-roasted ginkgo nuts. The whole is sweet, cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt wood, leather in dull, viscous bitterness.

Wonderful.\n\nWell, those 57% cask strength does not bother at all. Very quaffable. Pineapple returns, but then the candied version. Loads of pepper and a nice smokiness rear their heads.

Finish: medium long, a tad more drying now, which is normal, with something floral. Orange blossom water? Quite some menthol in the aftertaste, it’s almost as if you had just sucked a few mint drops. Comments: quite miraculous. It’s got something of both the Mortlach and the Glenlivet 70yo by G&M.

During world war 2 she was responsible for safe guarding Laphroaig’s stock and equipment from theft and damage while operations were mothballed. Over 400 tonnes of ammunition were stored at Laphroaig during these years. She is credited with growing Single malt whisky as a brand in the US and positioning Laphroaig as a brand for the future. When Ian Hunter died in 1954 Bessie inherited Laphroaig, his home, and the island of Texa. She obviously made a huge impact, quite a testament to her character. Fast forward 6 years and this spirit was laid down in a cask...and now in 2019, into my glass...\n\nN: Very soft and delicate. All these notes are light, but completely complementary . Any brash peaty notes have been soaked into the wood leaving what I can only describe as a resin. It’s as if you cut down the grandest of oak trees and smelled right in the center of it after it rained. Very soft tar, pine, a minerality like crushed wet rocks or wool, hint of fresh dill, sea spray. I wouldn’t go as far to call it tropical, but there is undeniably more there. Old lemongrass, with a drop of pineapple juice. Very delicate and complex nose that evolves for hours in the glass. Stunning. It’s weird to say, but I feel like I could actually smell the tree that was used. Just this old grand elegant cask, beautiful Laphroaig spirit and time. That’s it. It’s actually kind of beautifully simple.\n\nP: Creamy, soft wax, light green tea notes, soft tar, faint lychee, a drop of pineapple juice, more sap/soft mint. It seems silly to put pen to paper on all these notes when you simply realize it is a delicate symphony of flavours and your brain cannot keep up.\n\nF: Lemon oil, sea spray, like taking a walk through the forest after a storm. crushed wet rocks, tannins from the wood (pleasant), pinecones, soft tar, shorter finish. Anything less than forever is of course too short.\n\n93/100\n\nIt’s only a difficult dram to describe. When you have it, it makes perfect sense. It’s very light and delicate. There is a lot there, but you feel almost silly pulling out the few notes you are capable of, because it is so much more. The nose was my favourite part. I can (and did) smell this for hours. I only had a small sample that I shared with a friend. I’m sure if I had more time the score would only increase.\n\nSo is it better than a Brora 35? Laphroaig 25? Springbank 21? Highland Park 30? I wouldn’t say for sure. It’s different. What’s certain is that it is a beautiful whisky of a time and style gone by. A piece of history. A time when the future of Islay whisky was not guaranteed. When Bessie Williamson was trail blazing the way for Laphroaig, Islay, and women in the Industry. My grandfather was not even 30 at the time. Etta James released her famous album “At Last”. Cost of a new house was $12,700 in 1960. This whisky was already in the cask for 9 years before we landed on the moon. Now how can you not get romantic about that? Thank you to my generous friend for the sample. Sláinte Mhath.', 'Refined, elegant, restrained but complex and deep old Laphroaig. Premium stuff! 93/94.\nNose\n94\n94\nRestrained, but complex.

So I am in the extremely lucky position to open and drink all the bottles that were earmarked as a backup for my pension age so far.  And I start with this legendary bottle of the oldest Laphroaig that ever was released (up to now).  I bought bottle no. 0038 for 460 Euro (900 Deutschmark) in December, 2001.\n\nThis is one of the most complex and elegant drams I tasted so far with the broadest aromas and flavours profile of them all, most probably.  It is simply delicious and a lot of fun to explore (if you are lucky enough to enjoy more than just a small sample).  Contrary to most of the high-priced modern releases of 40-years old whiskies this dram is worth every cent of the release price of 460 Euro per bottle.  Is it worth today\'s outrageous price tag?  It all depends upon the deepness of your pockets...\n\n[September 2020] Thanks to my sample library I am able to re-taste this dram tonight and I am as flabbergasted as I was the first time. It is very delicate and subtle with all my taste buds dream of: fruits and peat, molten sugars and medicinal aromas, oils, waxes, herbs, spices and and and... all in a perfectly balanced mix. I could sniff and chew this for hours!\n\n[December 2022] Another re-taste during the longest night of the year (winter solstice), and I am tempted to raise the score to 96 points tonight. Take your time with such an old beauty, it will reward both your olfactory cells and taste buds accordingly.\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is amber, and the texture shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass that builds some fat sticky tears over time that refuses to build legs at all (a great oiliness!). The nose is rather shy for a (modern) Laphroaig - but hey, this baby slept for 40 years, and of course anything looses some power over such a long time. But it gained an incredible complexity instead: Actually there are at least twenty to thirty different aromas to find (and I do not own the finest nose at all), very delicate and elegant with not a single off-note. Perfectly balanced - one to sniff for hours (but do not expect anything that comes close to today\'s ""I-punch-that-in-ya-face"" Laphroaig style).\nTaste\n95\n95\nThe taste is about as delicate and complex as was the nose with even some richer flavours, especially the peaty and medicinal notes are stronger here. I really like that! It is truly multi-layered, and I have to force myself to finally swallow the whisky as my taste buds cannot get enough of this tasty experience.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe dram arrives smooth and absolutely charming on the palate. It immediately covers the whole of the mouth and shows not a single bitter or astringent wooden note (again, if you like the modern style wood-driven Laphroaig forget about this one). This is by far the best arrival I experienced since years! Close to perfection... The finish is long (but it could be longer if you ask my taste buds) and without any distracting moment, too. Absolutely flawless and clean and with the same flabbergasting complexity as were the nose and the taste. Water is not needed.', 'Tasting note by Serge Valentin\n\n Laphroaig 40 yo (42.4%, OB, +/-2001) Five stars We’re revisiting this old glory… Colour: deep gold. Nose: much more delicate, rather on high-end marzipan, clams, old waxes and oils, hessian, old books, old bookshop (polish), beeswax, mint flavoured tea… All delicacy, all elegance, and quite the opposite of all the tens. Notes of plantains. The peat doesn’t feel much anymore, but its there, just very, very delicate. Soft eucalyptus, embrocations... An old lady who works in a very old pharmacy (says Angus).\n\nMouth: all delicacy and elegance. Not as light as I remembered, certainly not too oaky, but there’s a subtle mintiness, lovely bitter oranges, a touch of angelica (quite a lot of angelica, in fact) and the most complex and elegant coastal peatiness. There’s more than I remembered. Finish: medium length. Citrons, oranges, crème de menthe, genepy, aniseed… Superb ultra-clean aftertaste.

The smoke and the oak together form a harmonious bouquet and carry the remaining flavors seamlessly. Air-dried ham with a pinch of sea salt. A mint leaf cools and refreshes the nose. Again and again a sweetness comes out, reminiscent of a tropical salad of mango, papaya and honeydew melon, doused with a light vanilla sauce. Simply fantastic this interplay between the smoke, the oak and the sweetness. As soon as one has caught the yellow exotic fruits in the nose, the heavy spices settle on the aroma, in order to release the sweetness the next moment, stunning. In the taste, the aroma continues.

Highland Park 40-year-old,93.49,296,"['Highland Park 40 year is simply stunning and the finest whisky I’ve sampled during my time writing for The Dramble. The flavour delivery is precise, the balance is perfect, and the development and finish offer almost endless depth and complexity.\nNose\nExquisitely rich and expressive, but given the hefty age statement, you’ll not be surprised when I suggest that some substantial resting time (over 30 minutes) is required here. Once fully opened, there’s nothing shy about this nose – wonderful maturity and remarkable aroma development – it’s hauntingly sexy and an experience you’re unlikely to want to end….ever. Pronounced leather, mahogany polish and musty bone dry paper conjure up images of a wood-panelled Victoria library packed to the rafters with ancient leather-bound tomes. The traditional Highland Park profile is still extraordinarily strong here – dried highland grasses, heathery honey and sweet wispy smoke – but everything is richer, deeper and altogether more refined. Orange peels, Peruvian dark chocolate and liquorice merge with luxuriant dark berry fruits, prune juice and dusty aged spices – cinnamon and nutmeg. The level of smoke here is surprising, it’s still a wafting background aroma, packed full of burnt hays, stubbed out cigars and tinder boxes – but it’s much more pronounced that one might expect from 40 years of maturation – this results in a peat that seeming both ancient and refined and yet lively and spry at the same time. Woodiness levels are unsurprisingly high – and yet still somehow restrained – highly polished dark old wood – not a trace of young sappy vanilla and with plenty of beeswax and lacquered furniture. Beautiful, captivating and lingering. I could nose this forever.\nTaste\nUnctuous, slightly oily and with a perfectly judged arrival that delivers a surge of refined flavour with almost no perceptible alcohol despite the 48.3% ABV. Yes, friends, if you’re judging whisky on its ‘smoothness’ this is as smooth as they come. The front palate offers up a stunning balance of mouth-coating burnt sweet heather and cinder toffee, sitting alongside raisins, orange and dried citrus peels. This develops (slowly) into perfectly judged bitterness – from both spices and wood. Cinnamon, nutmeg, a sprinkle of white pepper and then a wave of tanned leather, ancient saddle hides, dusty books, teak oil, mahogany and ebony woods. The development continues into the back palate where sweetness returns to balance the deeper, spicier wood-led flavours – a harvest of juicy, reduced red and black fruit jams and preserves alongside chocolate and burnt honeycomb. Smoke runs throughout, but is most discernible in the back palate – it’s an intriguing and subtle combination of sun-scorched hays, burnt sugars and coastalness.

Top of the pyramid as far as sherried Speysiders are concerned, all brands and distilleries included. Colour: light mahogany with red hues. Nose: totally astounding, as expected. Roasted chestnuts and chestnut honey speaking out first, which I adore, then precious wood polish and varnish (old Jag as we used to say), then two or three hundred different dried fruits (papayas, dates, currants, figs, guavas…) then the most fantastic chocolates as well as some well-roasted robusta coffee (beans), then tiny 'Asian' notes, miso, cheng-pi, hoisin, soy sauce… And umami sauce!

Then tar, liquorice, pu-her, more chestnut honey, heather as well, white clover honey, bags of raisins, a drop of sriracha and one of tabasco… But rather less meaty/gamey tones than in other similar bottlings. With water: it's the tightness, the freshness, the vivacity that's most impressive here. Some sublime figs, kumquats and bergamots plus some superlative mints of all kinds, while I could not find even the faintest flaw this far. Not even 'wood'. Finish: this is where they would tend to become a little woody, a little drying, a little too 'tannic'. Not this one!

Very complex, the aromatic palette gradually reveals red and black fruits (redcurrant, blackcurrant), chocolate, salted butter caramel and incense. Exceptional.\nPalate: noble, full of life. Remarkably fresh, the attack on the palate invites us to taste nectarines, melons, mangoes, oranges, ripe bananas, walnuts, apricots and their stones, cherries, bergamots, squeezed lemons, mandarins, etc… In addition deliciously vanilla, it extends on flavors of aromatic plants (sage, chamomile, rosemary). This transition in no way affects the fruity character of the aromatic palette, on the contrary, it transcends it. Remarkable.\nOverall: long, concentrated. Iris concrete, candied ginger, gentian roots, eucalyptus leaves and toffee provide plenty of smoothness and sensuality at the start of the finish. The very end of the palate has medicinal (balm, mustard seed) and nobly spicy (saffron, cardamom) accents of magnificent luminosity. On the retro-olfaction, orange zest, dried apricots, toffee and malted barley grains show that the aromatic and taste palette has not taken a single wrinkle.

Nose: much ‘calmer’ than the 1971 at first nosing, although this one is very sherried as well. But the cavalry arrives after two or three minutes: a great mix of pine resin and toffee – as expected – but also lots of spearmint and camphor. Develops on beeswax and furniture polish, Grand-Marnier, tiger balm… Not extremely bold, rather delicate but still highly satisfying on the nose. Lots of dried fruits – pineapple and guava again. Hints of seawater, caramel crème, fudge. A massive complexity indeed. Some notes of orange flowers, whiffs of natural rubber.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful, even a bit nervous. No sign of tiredness at all. Stunning! Ah and there’s also quite some apricot jam. Keeps developing after fifteen minutes, getting more and more like a very old sweet wine – but a great one (Yquem or some Gewurztraminer Rangen VT from Olivier’s). I can’t remember having had a malt that was that close to a (great) wine on the nose. Mouth: ah! I must admit I was a bit scared, after the little oops we just had with the 1971, but this is beautiful. Again a little ‘simpler’ than on the nose, but still very, very enjoyable. Pine syrup, caramel crème, chocolate sauce, old Port, but also lots of dried fruits (sultanas, guavas). Salted butter caramel. Now, it’s true that the tannins do arrive after a moment, and bold ones at that. It gets oakier and oakier in fact, and quite drying but it’s easily bearable. Nothing excessive in a 50 yo malt, that’s for sure. The finish is rather long, somewhat drying and a little bitter again but this one has good excuses, doesn’t it? And we all know that very old malts are rarely really excellent, don't we? Anyway, a totally stunning nose and a very, very good palate make a high rating: 93 points, this time!

Ardbeg 1974,93.38,23,"[""My first 'old' Ardbeg, I was lucky enough to score a sample at the Lindores whisky festival. Frankly, this has nothing to do with the 'new' Ardbeg, which is for more peaty and powerful.\n\nThis Ardbeg is far more 'civilized', with a great combo of flavours. There's fruity flavors (mango, guave) but also a more 'candy-like' profile, like liquorice, and some flavours that specifically remind me of some candy we eat with the 'Sinterklaas' celebration in Holland. It has a slightly nutty side (almondy) to it, which I usually extremely dislike (being allergic to them), but not nearly bother me as much a usually. There's obviously a medicinal and peaty side to this as well, but not as powerful and overwhelming as the newer bottlings.

More so than even Brora or Karuizawa it would seem. Up today, a pair from this lost distillery.\n\nN: This possesses an incredible textural viscosity that’s got something of the butchers about it. We are talking of organs and the like: liver, heart, kidneys etc,.. Also, we’ve a few descriptors from the garden including soils and fertilisers as well as a stewed fruitiness in the form of > tincture-y rhubarb, freshly-cut strawberries, passing hints of kiwi with > sage and mint-seasoned < sun-dried raisins which lead to the complex old balsamic sherry cask’s big moment. The rancio heart appears live enough to be moving with sweet-sour damp-fungal=wood-dry notes that conjure memories of visits to old wine & sherry warehouses and outdoor wine tastings in Tuscany. A hundred reviewers would provide thousands of different descriptors for a nose like this. Just know that there’s enough going on to stir or indeed evoke an emotion or two.\n\nT: Again, the abv takes me by surprise but it’s easily & willingly tamed. Unlike the 1966 Signatory, however, this one isn’t so willing to unravel right away. This is so potent that the incredible bitter-sweet~sour deep sherry-fruit-based arrival is hard to muster in words. Sounds, or lack of them, tell the story of a stunned man. Slowly, these grand old sherry notes begin to emerge with details I’ve never experienced before. Add water and it’s sweeter, kinder, more candid and moreish with a complexity underlying. Finally opening towards a bitter herbal sweet affair, the abv effortlessly carries aloft, flavour molecules without obtrusiveness. Wonderful!\n\nF: Does the cask dominate? No, but it certainly steers. What we are left with is a complex dusty-musty berry-fruity earthy sherry-driven smorgasbord of orthonasal & retronasal olfactory references that a culmination of thousands of wine & spirits tastings along with numerous visits to distilleries & warehouses, vineyards & cellars might give you. Some sort of sour rancio to finish, the sherry driving this all the way home.\n\nC: Whisky you could easily slug without thinking – if you had the means and the nerve – but you’d miss a trip of a lifetime. This makes me want to explore sherry with immediate effect.', 'For my 2000th review here on WB, I thought I would have a treat from one of my favourite closed distilleries, in my view Glenugie is still underrated.\nSince I have started drinking whisky there are few that leave me undecided, this is one of them, yes it is good and in parts superb , especially the finish but because the palate never really settles it loses a few marks,\nSuch a powerful fruity malt but the power does not come from the faint peat in the mix and there is the difference.\nThis is a hand grenade of fruit and fizz and it swamps you, a bunker buster of fruit.\nWhat a rollercoaster of a journey, not what I was expecting after the other two 67,68 Sestante Glenugie I have tried.\nNose\n93\n93\nThe first thing that hits use is the fruit (I like to use a glass lid to keep the aromas in).\nThere are various tropical fruits and in particular mango & papaya but there is also kiwi fruit, a little green apple, faint dark honey.\nWith the lid off and air things begin to change, the fruit seems to decrease to reveal mixed with the fruit some new leather notes, brick dust (if you have ever sawed a brick in half with a stihl saw you will know what I mean here).\nAfter a few more minutes the green apple returns and then it is a bag of fruit gums.\nTaste\n91\n91\nVery spicy, very fruity and it almost is splitting my tongue in two, there is peat there but that fruity sherbet fizz is really powerful as your mouth get used to it.\nMy initial thought is that neat is quite dry and ever so slightly woody and bitter, I think water will really open this up?\nWaves of spice wash over tongue but it is too much of a good thing, the amount of fizz and spice hide the fruit, don`t get me wrong here I like , very entertaining but it swamps everything else at first but if you keep going the fruit gum notes and some orange notably come out, it is a marmalade note I am getting.\nThings are not in harmony here, I am hoping a little water tames this.\nThe flavours are great mind\nFinish\n93\n93\nMassive, it is very long and very spicy , nothing more to say.\n\nWith Water:-\n\nNose 93 points no change\nEven more fruit has been released and more leather, everything seems just a little more composed, new to the scene is a caramel waffle note which is a welcome addition from a balance perspective.\n\nPalate\nSill very fizzy and very powerful but again the balance is not there for me, the power this has is awesome though, I can admire it just for that alone.\nagain it starts to get dry with a faint bitterness but at the moment that is not a negative.\n\nFinish\nAfter a little more time in the glass the explosion of fruit flavours is immense.\nPalate', ""An extremely memorable 2cl experience.

Time for something special, so why not the oldest single malt I've ever tasted?\n\nThese old, old G&M Mortlachs and Linkwoods are rather delicate, since they lack the bold sherry notes of the darker Strathislas and Glen Grants. However, they are also marvels of complexity and extinct tastes, and frankly, soon without bottles like these around to show future enthusiasts what Scotch at its best can be, quo vadis, whisky industry? I doubt I'll be writing something like this about some STR casked contemporary wonder in 20 years.\n\nFor the record, I found this better than the Ardbeg 1974 Provenance 55,6% (93 pts.) I had in the glass next to it.\nNose\nDry old herbs and pepperminty touches, so OBE is here. Then this gentle sal-ammoniac, appreciably different from that of Islay whiskys or Talisker of the same era in that this is more dry, and not so attacking. Old leather and paper, as if nosing a bunch of well worn books. Old newspapers, gingerbread, a bit of butter, and extremely age-rounded wood that hasn't become too bitter or hazelnut-y. With time the leathery side grows a lot, and I feel like under 20-25 minutes in the glass doesn't do this any justice, much like many other 40-43% old glories that only give up the goods to those who are patient. Bone dry cigar leaves, and some grandma's hard candy drops, so old they melted a bit and clumped together in the tin she had in her cupboard. Some of the best chess piece notes I've ever nosed, and most excellent coffee. I might be in love.\nTaste\nOh, it's fruity? What a surprise. Not boldly tropical or anything, but pleasant, and reminds me of some fruitier old cognacs. Then these touches of old, old tannins with a bit of bitterness but nothing overwhelming or out of tune there. Lots of dried herbs, peppermint, and that sal-ammoniac again. At first this was a bit shy on the palate, but in 45 minutes it went from roughly 90 points to a total winner. Amazing development, and no boring moments! This is like a deluxe version of the G&M Mortlach 100° Proof mini, which is definitely worth checking out for the price it auctions. If you haven't tried that mini, why are you still here reading this? Go find it already.\nFinish\nHere we fumble a bit, but just a bit, due to the age of the malt, and possibly the fact that this bottle must've been open a while. The finish is like everything that has gone before, but it is a bit quiet especially compared to the nose. Still, the balance is exquisite, and the old leather in the tail is to die for.

Finally, I can do a proper review now.\n\nAnd this is flabbergasting stuff, indeed! One of the most complex and quaffable Ardbegs I ever tasted, deadly dangerously quaffable to be precise. I could empty such a bottle in one go alone. But is this fun? No, it is much better to share it with good friends like tonight...\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is deep gold and the nose offers the early seventies Ardbeg complexity at its best. This is a peaty bonfire in-between an old byre and a freshly tarred road. Later a full load of hospital-alike aromas join in while the maritime notes take their time until they show up. This is the utmost complexity of flavours I can think of, there are additional autumn floral, oily, leathery and and and ... aromas. What an experience!\nTaste\n96\n96\nThe taste is multi-layered and challenging to explore because every layer is quite complex in itself. There is a hide-and-seek of sweet, peaty and spicy-herbal flavours that is funny to follow but hard to catch. It is pure pleasure to chew and explore, but it is even more joyful to simply quaff this dram without ""analysis paralysis"". Water releases even more aromas in the nose and flavours on the palate - actually, I like this dram both neat and somewhat reduced.\nFinish\n96\n96\nThe initial mouthfeel is impressive and bold with a warming and creamy coating effect and a minor drying moment from the heavy peating level (cold ashes). The finish is virtually endless and gets sweeter on molten sugars and citric fruits which is very delicious.

The more ‘direct’ notes are those of old leather, coal smoke, prunes and library dust. There’s a sherried fruitiness, with fruit compote and plum jam, but it’s pushed aside by this lovely pre-war style of coals, herbs and oils. I couldn’t possibly mention everything, but I also noted eucalyptus, pine resin, fruit cake, camphor, tobacco, herbal liqueur, raspberry ganache, mint, cedar, caramelized sugar… All of this on a background of typical 1940’s-1950’s blend notes. Mouth: the first thing that struck me was “babelutte”, a kind of hard butter toffee typical for the Belgian coast. Quite spectacular. Then the other notes appear: smoke, wax, sultanas, almonds, mint, red fruit gums, Turkish delight… It keeps developing on toffee / mocha / chocolate notes, really great. Hardly any oak, hardly any bitter notes, no dryness whatsoever – rather perfect. Maybe a few metallic notes but very few considering it spent nearly 40 years in glass. Actually it’s an asset here. Finish: really long, with smoke and soft resin. Hints of tea as well.\n\nIt doesn’t require an elaborate conclusion to know this was exceptional. Pre-war whisky, from directly fired stills, with old-style sherry and smoke harmoniously mixed. Try to taste this kind of whisky before it’s gone forever!

After pouring wonderfully silky and reddish amber sloshing in Premium Snifter, on the glass wall has formed a thick and oily streak. Long ""legs"" majestically pull their oily tracks back into the glass, but visually this old Macallan pleases me for the first time today. Ripe hazelnuts rise up creamy, creamy roasted flavors mingle with sweet caramelized sugar and creamy peach. Dark berries and grapes end in dried dates and raisins, hints of sour cherries and a delicate tobacco aroma beguile the senses. Mandarins, plums, hints of leather, tobacco and minimal smoky notes alternate sweet and fruity, the nose is incredibly balanced and creamy. The sweet and fruity base flavor will not let me go, for the first time I think I know what makes Paxarette. The sweet grape concentrate is dominant in the foreground, creamy nuts and bittersweet chocolate now and then make their way through the incredibly fruity sweetness, shadow morels and abrasion of orange peel massively stimulate the salivation. I could smell forever on this dreamy nose, the aroma is just beguiling!\nTaste\nSour cherries, with their spicy oak tones and dark berries, give off their unruly aroma at the first sip. Roasted hazelnuts and caramelized sugar are creamy, plums and dates stick to the tongue, hints of leather and dried tobacco leaves end up minimally tart on the tongue. Dried grapes and berries stick sweet and creamy on the palate, walnuts and cedar wood are dominated by raisins and hints of grapefruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and oily, from time to time nuts and slightly dry wood elements flash on. Minimal milk chocolate comes to light while the second sip of creamy and mildly flowing through the palate. Leather and tobacco then show up in full splendor and challenge the dark and dried fruits to dance. Chocolate, hazelnuts, roasted aromas, sour cherries, sweet caramel, sun-ripened raisins, toffee, plums, leather, tobacco, minimal smoke and old walnuts dance Viennese waltzes on the tongue and make me dream of the old good whisky times.\nFinish\nSlowly the music stops and the dance couples dissolve. Nutty blurs the aromas, the sweet fruit sounds, creamy leather, tobacco and dark sherry aroma a felt eternity in memory. Cedar wood rests creamy with the faded leather and tobacco aromas on the palate, I gladly look to the side and take the last, final sip of this dreamy and special drop! The creamy nuts invite with leather, tobacco and the dark sherry aromas to another dance round. Again, the complete range of dreamy sherry flavors, including Paxarette and the dreamlike leather-tobacco combination is revealed.', ""OK.

Apricot pie, incense, cigar box, camphor, ginger, wood varnish, beeswax, banana skin, very old rum, leather polish, fresh almonds… And then the sherry comes out, almost brutally, with huge notes of coffee that just ran out of the expresso machine. Superb, very superb. Mouth: ho-ho-ho! Thick, deep, rich, fruity, phenolic and resinous, with once again a lot of oak and once again a beautiful one. An avalanche of dried fruits (figs, bananas, pears, apricots, dates, prunes… Actually, you have them all) as well as all spices (and even a little salt), all that doing ‘the peacock’s tail’ in the most beautiful manner. How rich! Finish: as long as a Neil Young guitar solo, maybe just a tad bitter now (the tannins are big) but with also some very, very ‘funny’ notes of raspberry eau-de-vie that make for an unexpected, yet most pleasant signature.

Powdered cocoa, licorice, emery cloth, iris concrete and brewed sage are just some of the ingredients that give this impressive bite to the palate so much complexity and richness. The mid-palate is roasted (coffee, tea) and spicy (saffron, caraway, turmeric). It should be noted that it is constantly refreshed by the juice of many fruits whether they are black (blackberry, blueberry), fresh (peach, apricot) or even exotic (mango, guava). Final: long, caressing. Its powdery tannins scarcely mark their taste buds. In fact, they emphasize the elegance of the finish. After aeration, notes of varnish, wax, dark chocolate and salted butter caramel take possession of the palate.

I rated this very high some time ago and I am curious if I will confirm this extraordinary score tonight.\n\nIn 1969 they started to use higher peating levels while still the excessive fruitiness is there.  This turns these drams into unbelievable complex and delicious flavour monsters that are simply unmatched.  The 1966-68 vintages offer a flabbergasting fruitiness but miss the peaty flavours while from 1970 onwards the peat increased further and the fruitiness vanished (during the ""bad years of Bowmore"" in the eighties it was gone completely).  I personally prefer the 1969 vintage - but to be honest:  Almost all Bowmore distilled before 1975 are great!\n\n[August, 2021] I re-tasted this dram tonight and fully confirm my old review. Excellent stuff with an outstanding nose.\nNose\n96\n96\nThe colour is jonquiripe corn and the texture shows very slow moving legs and late fat sticky tears (a great oiliness, indeed). The nose offers an adorable mix of very fruity, peaty, maritime and spicy wooden aromas in close-to-perfection harmony. I could sniff this for hours and still detect something new in it. What a nose!\nTaste\n93\n93\nThe taste is unbelievably complex and nicely layered with all that I expect from an old Bowmore: excessive fruitiness (with the trademark Bowmore flavours passion fruits, black and red currants and dozens of other exotic and home-grown fruits), well-matured (sweet) peaty flavours, maritime impressions and of course some herbs and spices. No off-note that I can find.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe dram arrives absolutely charming on the palate: creamy, warming and instantly coating with a very little astringent feeling from the tannins (which is not distracting at all and quite normal after 36 years of maturation). The finish is very long and literally sticks to both your palate and throat before vanishing slowly in fading waves. Yes, this is Bowmore at its best.', '[October, 2015]  While there is (almost) no peat in the 1966-68 vintages of Bowmore they used more peat from 1969 on.  This leads to a very fine combination of (still the 60ies) terrific fruitiness, sweet barley sugars and subtle peat smoke after 36 years in the cask.\n\nOf course, the 1966 ""fruit bombs"" are delicious and mouth watering.  But this one kept (most) of their magnificent fruitiness and added several additional layers of complex (peat induced) aromas.  It is like expanding a beautiful old painting into the third dimension.

It is, without a doubt, a great dram that lacks the Olympus but lacks balance in the overall picture because the impressions of the nose are too different from the taste / finish. You also have to be a fan of this massive oak cargo.\nNose\nThis dram is already an experience before the first smelling. The dark color, the viscous drops on the glass wall and the thoughts of 1973 make you want more.\nThe sherry is already in the room. A first tentative smelling brings many impressions of sweet sherry, red ripe cherry and old oak cabinet wall. First of all, the sherry dominates the picture, a powerful creamy and intense sweetness, honey, fruit compote of ripe plums, cherries, raisins, sultanas, blackberries, very ripe strawberries, the oak pushes sometimes less intervening and shows presence. The dark red fruit salad is now added a splash of lemon juice and cut sweet orange juice, milk chocolate, coated with chocolate dates, figs. Contrary to the intense sherry fruit and the perceptible oak tones vibrates constantly a fresh herbal note like mint, probably also resin and this ""freshness"" of conifers, cinnamon and bitter cocoa powder, the softwood (pine) is more pronounced, dry coconut flakes, a great, very delicious sherry-dominated nose\nTaste\ntart and less sweet than expected, really dry intense sherry with fruitiness, strong oak, oak, resin, pine, berry, plum, the mouth sticks to dryness, walnuts, orange peel, tart chocolate, tobacco, leather, not quite ripe figs, passion fruit , incredibly mouth-filling without being sweet (later, no sweetness is more noticeable), minimal honey, really strong spicy oak\nFinish\na strong note of mint and resin spreads dry at first in the mouth, cough drops, oak, chocolate, kräutrig, some resin, gin-like, significantly less fruit, dry Virginia tobacco, again figs, Nussigkeit, dry orange peel, lasts long lasting until eternal the massive oak freight', 'definitely the Best!

Glen Grant 1950 GM,93.23,29,"['My God, what a fantastic Glen Grant. 1950… That makes it the oldest whisky – from a vintage point of view – that I have tried. No less than 57 years in oak and already 10 years in the bottle. Liquid history. What a privilege. And it immediately tumbles into my personal top ten! Still available at La Maison du Whiskty, but it will set you back 4.200 EUR. Good beyond reckoning.\nNose\nWonderfully sweet nose on red and yellow fruit, but also baked apples. Reminds me somewhat of Madeira. Very round and rich. Hints of chocolate and a pinch of spices.\nTaste\nIt is oily and mouthcoating and offers some toasted oak alongside the fruit.

Love the orchard fruits, particularly the apples that come across as baked with brown sugar. The wine influence in this cask is just right for me, dialed in perfectly. There is a dark chocolatey note that comes from the wood, along with a slight espresso note. The two blend perfectly together. In the mouth, I\'m getting a very viscous mouthfeel with more orchard fruits but in the mouth the fruits are stewed rather than baked and they have a spicy wood note that reminds me of allspice. It\'s like ""whisky compote!"" Just brilliant. A slight smokiness reminds me of a twenty year old Ben Nevis that I currently have open in my cabinet. Except in this case, the smokiness is even better. It\'s not peat, mind you. I don\'t think it\'s peat at all, in fact the wood reminds me of very old mountain cabins that I\'ve smelled, almost like a wonderful dry rot smell that is not off-putting at all, strange as that may seem, but instead just charming. Not a wet musty note at all, but a dry, crisp wood note here. OMG, this is a little taste of ancient times. The finish ends like a prayer, with a promise of atonement. Will the next sip taste as good? Yes, I think so. I\'m in whisky heaven for sure. . . .', 'I have never wanted so much a few percent more - one can only hope that was not significantly diluted, but by itself just made the 40%.

However, if you also want to enjoy the taste and the finish, you should or must take your mouth fuller, otherwise the whisky is gone before you even had half of the enjoyment.\nEspecially if you take larger sips anyway (and heavy stuff is used to), you should probably not start under 5cl in this case.\n\nMy order:\n1955> 1951/1953> 1954> 1950/1952\n(with the ""straight"" especially the ""thinness"" with taste and finish strikes)\n\nNevertheless, * if * I had 2000 € hobby budget a month, I would probably take half the annual budget, buy me a six-pack, tear it up and enjoy it with friends. Just because it works and is delicious and the numbers on the bottle but somehow fun.\n(In any case, rather than me-times to put the same bottles in the cellar. ;-))\n\n(This tasting was probably my biggest challenge so far ... Careful, just do not miss a molecule, just do not waste a drop ... horror and fun and you get old like a cow and still learn.)\nNose\nWhen pouring exotic fruit salad, Haribo Goldbären, intense, yummy ... in the glass then first surprise: Nix fruit, but wood smoke, not too strong, old, dusty. Ups, 20 cm above the glass again fruit salad. Slowly lower, sweeter, with 5cm milk chocolate, directly on the glass again wood and light smoke. Funny game. After 20 minutes, the fruit salad struggles forward in the glass and mixes with wood and chocolate.\nTaste\nIn the beginning shortly fruit salad, then chocolate, forest honey, when he has spread properly on the tongue, it\'s a (thin) mixture of licorice, cough syrup and herbal bitters with a tiny idea residual smoke, unfortunately, the pleasure is far too short, the 40% are too dilapidated by the salivation.\nFinish\nI swallow quickly, there are in the finish medium again cough drops, camillan, wood.

Liquid cola syrup mixed with freshly brewed espresso, walnut wine, root beer, sarsaparilla extract, some dark and ancient cough medicine, cherry eau de vie, raisins stewed in old cognac and a huge, simmering, earthy and tar-flecked peatiness. Greasy engines, old tool boxes, oily rags, hessian, brown bread, sooty coal scuttles, mushroom powder, coffee granules and game meats. Utterly immense and bewildering stuff! Like being miniaturised and dropped into the heart of an old Aston Martin DB5 engine parked in a desolate peat moor (Serge’s ultimate fantasy by the way). With water: rosewater, BBQ char, eucalyptus resin, strawberry wine, some very gloopy old balsamico and things like roast chestnuts, more tar and creosote. If you ever wanted to tar and feather someone from the inside out... Mouth: Bovril, bacon, beef stock, iodine, tar, lemongrass, peach stones, black coffee, peppered mackerel, biltong... maltoporn guys, are you around? With water: peat, oil, tar, medicine, seawater, liquorice, herbs, earth, bouillon, rancio... seriously, we’d better stop! Finish: glorious, immensely long, fatty, greasy, mechanical, earthy, herbal, medical and sooty. A laboratory, on a farm, in a field, next to a beach, downwind from a hospital, in a glass - with a workshop. And a cow! Comments: Silly whisky. Not suitable for vegans. (No offence vegans.)

Walnut. dark chocolate cream.', '... some personal considerations and opinions regarding ""High-End Whisky"" (with respect to price and rates):\n\nI believe that the rating at ""whiskybase.com"" is quite an adequate guide for a first orientation before buying a test bottle. My strategy, if a sample is unavailable (in most cases, unfortunately), is to select a distillery whose profile I like anyway, then taking an average from ratings from whiskybase as well as from other reviewers whose taste fit well to mine in the past. Further very important is to read thoroughly the detailed notes of all reviewers to learn about the specific profile of the whisky.\n\nAt ""whiskybase.com"", the rating seems to fit quite well in maybe 80% of the cases if a certain minimum of votes is already available (should be at least 20-30 votes, the more the better). This does not sound self-evident because every whiskybase member can define his/her scheme to award a whisky quite individually. So for instance everyone sets another personal ""standard"" for a certain value for a perceived quality (whatever quality means to the member, it can be just the personal liking or the trial to rate some ""neutral"" properties), everyone spreads his personal scale in a different way, i.e. one member may use a wide scale between 50 and 100, another may use only a very narrow scale between 75 and 90. This leads to different statistical distributions with varying mean values and standard deviations (variances) being superimposed. From this it seems to be difficult to maintain a kind of normative result. However, practical experience shows that within a certain region (typically at least between 80 and 90 points) it works quite well. This is at least my personal feeling. The reason for this might be some statistical compensation of the outliers if a certain minimum number of votes contributes to the end result or some ""swarm intelligence"" where all members subliminally adapt a certain rating behaviour with more or less the same statistical mean and variance. \n\nSo, to a certain degree it seems to work. But I recognized (again my personal observation, only, of course) that this is only true for the range between 80 and 90 points. Especially when it comes to rates above 90 points, it seems that maybe expectation of something very special leads to exaggerated and not realistic verdicts. Maybe again a ""swarm intelligence"" effect (following trends), however this time counterproductive. For instance there might be a famous name or charismatic distillery, there might be a ""lost distillery"" like, e.g. Port Ellen or Brora, there might be a very old age (e.g. 40 y.o.), there might be the feeling ""everything used to be better in the past"" for whiskies bottled in the last century, there might be top (but still personal!) verdicts from renowned whisky gurus, there might be already a lot of good ratings to follow blindly, or there might be simply - for whatever reason - a high market price (""an expensive thing cannot be bad."") etc., etc. ...\n\nThis seems to induce some mysterious expectation leading to the rates above 90 points. I have tasted whiskies at 92, 93, 94 points, and yes, they were different than whiskies at 88, 89, 90 points. But were they better? My clear answer is \'No\'. Not in general, maybe not even in average. I feel a clear quality slope between whiskies between 85 and 90, much, much more between 80 and 90, and an extremely strong slope between 75 and 90. But in the top range between 89 and 95 for me it seems more to be based on expectation and imagination.\n\nThe whiskies with >89 points are excellent in most cases, and having this excellence up one\'s sleeve the charismatic variety and individualism is quite high within this quality group. So we find a lot of different individual characters, but on par with each other if it comes to intrinsic quality. So, my impression is that within this high quality domain it is no longer sensible to compare these individuals by a pure number ""xxx/100"". Individual tasting notes, however, are still quite helpful to learn about the specific profile.\n\nBut even with the detailed descriptions of nosing and tasting one should stay careful. If you read and compare notes from different people, especially if they did not publish them at the same review site (where people first read and then write), the details can differ quite a lot. The associations arising from smell and taste can be quite different when it comes to a detailed description based on reference flavours, such as from different fruit, chocolate, coffee, herbs, and so on. The same phenomenon is known from, e.g., wine tastings, here blind tests uncovered that repeated recognition of the taste descriptions often fails, even by wine testing professionals and sommeliers. Even artificially coloured white wine was accepted to be quality red wine etc.. For example see the research results by Robert Hodgson ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-63947536.html ).\n\nBut let\'s quote another example of expectation-driven imagination and verdicts. This comes from a completely different field, the HiFi audio community where the enthusiasts are seeking for the best sound quality. Here, the prices for technical HiFi equipment range from small amounts below 100 Euros to prices for so called high-end equipment for more than 100,000 Euros (e.g. for amplifiers). Enthusiasts even pay thousands of Euros for a simple electrical interconnection cable with special ""voodoo"" design (e.g. silver coated or with other special features). From pure technical perspective, all these cables have - with respect to the relevant audio frequency range - exactly the same transfer properties, so it does not matter if it is a simple wire for one Euro, only, or if it is such a special luxury wire for >1000 Euros, the sonic quality will always be equal. The same is valid for other kind of HiFi equipment, e.g. some HiFi enthusiasts believe in the extraordinary excellent sound quality of expensive mechanically damped Compact Disk drives for 10,000 Euros, however each CD player has a digital buffer chip that collects all bits and repairs all faulty bits by a software algorithm. So physically there cannot be any difference in sound quality between a simple CD drive for 100 Euros and a high-end drive for 10,000 Euros (here I do not speak about D/A converters which may differ in sonic quality). Even the professional HiFi magazines rate all different HiFi components by a sonic quality verdict with points, often between 0 and 100 points (in practice using only a sub-range). Within numerous blind tests it could be proven that all these rates, differences and points for certain groups of HiFi equipment are complete nonsense. For example the team from http://www.hifiaktiv.at.xserv08.internex.at/  has shown that most of the ratings for electrical cables, transistor amplifiers and CD players are complete nonsense.\n\nNevertheless, still many HiFi enthusiasts believe in the sonic differences based on the ratings from professional HiFi magazines. They seem to hear the sonic quality differences between 0...100 points (respectively within the relevant sub-range). And this comes from pure psychological imagination, in reality all these sonic differences do not exist!\n\n0...100 points, doesn\'t this sound quite familiar to us whisky enthusiasts?\n\nSo what about real quality differences and pure human imagination with regard to tasting whisky? Yes, they all taste different, no doubt, but what about the intrinsic quality level, so-called complexity level and so on???\n\nJust think about it ...\n\n... it may put some of all these tasting verdicts, notes, ratings and quality comparisons into perspective ... ;-)', 'This is an interesting whisky, especially regarding the palate (initial taste and body), however this extreme hype of >94 points* on average is very difficult for me to comprehend. Also the price: Nearly 2000 Euros??\n\nBut let\'s explain this a bit more. First of all please take this negative initial comment with a grain of salt. Because this is no bad whisky, no, not at all! So I gave it 91 points which is a high value (but not >94 ...).\n\nI had performed several tastings at different days. I selected those days only, where - by testing benchmark whiskies before - I was sure that my taste buds were optimally performing (taste is not at one\'s best every day. I find it very important to find a verdict through several tasting sessions, sometimes even by blind comparisons).\n\nI would say, this Port Ellen is on par with other great peaty whiskies, also including recent whisky releases that are still available at affordable prices. So for instance the great Lagavulin 12 y.o. Cask Strength. I think, in principle one cannot rate different whiskies with different taste and character in comparison but this is the established foundation of whisky quality rating (by reducing a verdict to a single number ""xxx out of 100""). So as all the world is doing this, I think that I am allowed to set a 12 y.o. Lagavulin on par with a 34 y.o. Port Ellen because I believe that in this case the quality level is indeed equal.\n\nNose: Dark old smoke. Old mouldily transformed sherry aromas. A certain complexity is there but a bit hidden behind an old smoky compactness. Some vanilla coming through the heavy old curtain.\n\nPalate: Very strong impact, the start is quite overwhelming. Antique overall character, the high age of 34 years can be well recognized as a guiding theme (""leitmotif"") from start to finish. This antique kind of taste can be found in many aged Port Ellens, by the way. But here it is interwoven with a dark ""kind of sherry"" flavour. What I want to express, the sherry and peat are transformed into a well integrated dark mouldy flavour. So by this aspect this whisky is quite unique. Kind of dignified precious smoke, heavy weight, quite mouldy, but this meant as a positive attribute. An association of a grave (smell inside a chamber tomb) arises. Sweetness and some fruity aromas are coming through the old heavy mouldiness. I love this mouldiness which you can find in such matured old whiskies, only. The finish is a bit too compact and not really striking, but still good and fitting well to the whole arc of suspense. The tasting session closes in a compact, but in the end quite satisfying way. So this is really an excellent and interesting malt whisky.\n\nBut coming back to my introducing remarks:\n\nAlthough this is an excellent whisky, I would never pay 2000 Euros for a single bottle. Maybe from a collector\'s point of view this price is alright but I rate whiskies from the standpoint of a connoisseur who wants to drink these whiskies. I think that whisky is for drinking and not for collecting dust. And even from an investor\'s point of view I would be sceptical. At least at some places (e.g. for ""exclusive"" bottles or some ""limited special releases"") the ongoing whisky hype is already kind of crazy. Maybe you can remember the historical tulip mania from 1637 (OK, just kidding, as the bizarre tulip mania cannot be compared to anything else. However, as a synonym for bubbles in general it is at least a warning memorial ;-)).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania\n\nSo to be honest: Nearly 2000 Euros for a single bottle of this (or other Port Ellens) ???\n\nOh, no no no ...\n\nFor 2000 Euros one can get 20 bottles of equally excellent Lagavulin 12 y.o. CS, or 33 bottles of excellent Laphroaig 10 y.o. CS batch 009, or 10 bottles of >20 y.o. brilliant Glendronach single 1st fill sherry casks, or, or, or, ...\n\nSo, what a weird price!\n\nAnd also the average rating here. 94.5* points? Never! (if compared to all those excellent whiskies being rated at 89 points, only)!\n\nP.S.: I would have liked to give zero (or 10) points for the absolutely inadequate price-performance ratio but as I want to rate a whisky only for its nose and palate, to meet the overall 91 points, I adjusted ""price"" to 80 and ""presentation"" to 100.\n\n*) 94.51 (106 votes) was the average whiskybase rate in the beginning of August 2017.\nNose\n88\n88\nTaste\n93\n93\nFinish\n90\n90', 'With the best I ever had in the glass\nNose\n96\n96\nTaste\n94\n94\nFinish\n96\n96', 'After a few minutes the first nose breathes, a wonderfully complex aroma with many fruits of apricot over sour cherry dates figs and above it a hint of warm campfire smoke.

He began to reveal his secrets, as if the Samarkand concubine was throwing his heavy dresses onto dusty carpets in the Turkish tent, one after another: a summer loft with dried fruits and herbs, then the sticky leather of an old chair in a wood closet, then a huge library of dusty books untouched for centuries, then heavy gold bars and antique linen with thick cracked paints, then dried cherries and plums in the stuffy kitchen and at the end a wooden diner table at noon, filled with sweet coffee.\n\nThe adhesive tape is so powerful, assertive and multifaceted that I was already shaken by his strength, now I understand why for the first 20 minutes he didn’t want to communicate with me at all. Water (5 drops) rounds the molt, reveals its more tender sides (even some heavy floral aromas make their way), but then it fades faster.\nI drank the next dram without water: I was digging in it for more than an hour and every 5 minutes that I brought the core, the molt transformed to disgrace, reincarnating with every vulture. What is most striking is that these metamorphoses occurred very clearly pronounced, without any semitones or hints.\n\nHere is the complete opposite of the previous Girich, who fascinated with his sea haze of freedom ... then on the contrary, the suffocation of dusty golden palaces, but she is magically mesmerizing as the tale Shakherazady and even with Shakherazada itself after her tales.\n\nIt is difficult to express this power and at the same time the delicacy of each instrument entering its part from a high note, but let it be a favorite classic, for example, with its overture to “Abduction from Séral” https://youtu.be/akHXs32GceI, where in a huge orchestra alternately give a note to each instrument and I feel like a small conductor standing in the middle of Glenkern, inside the harmony of divine melodies, flying around me in a glass that I have in my palms. And this multi-layeredness, like a dream in a dream, tears away from the outcome and I am drowning in limbo, where time flows infinitely slowly, then slows down and comes back ... and through the mist of time you can see some kind of young Italian who without proficiency in the language and without money in your pocket, in dark unlit basements on some big island on the edge of the world, surrounded by harsh northern guys, chooses some barrels with an absolutely incomprehensible to the world drink. It is so mesmerizing that I can no longer understand where the reality for which I clung so few minutes ago, and whether it is needed now at all.\n\nThe brilliant Silvano Samaroli!

This was obviously written by someone not knowing much about whisky and how some very old ones can be absolutely wonderful and marvellous. At almost twice the age of what that author considered undrinkable, this Glen Grant 1948 is a bit woody, sure, maybe a tad too much, but boy is there way more than just wood there.\n\nThis whisky smelt and tasted of “before”. It made me think of the hunting room at my late grandparents’ manor in Sologne region in France where they would put the boots, old shoe polish and hunting rifles (and my mother had that thought too). The smell and the taste of old tanned leather. The smell and taste of 30 years ago (for me) or 50 years ago or more (for my parents). A trip back in time, down memory lane. Quite a fitting way to celebrate my father’s 70th birthday. And to hell for the etiquette and waiting 5 more years. I don’t want to wait when I can try whiskies like this one. Even though a tad too woody.\nNose\n88\n88\nA soft nose greets you with gentle wood, soft touches of vanilla and honey, and a surprising meaty side. After some time, there are the slightest touches of grapefruit. The meaty notes become something between an old leather saddle and tanned leather, as well as old shoe polish made of turpentine. The wood scents are not heavy on oak, but make me think more of cedar wood. Finally, there are earthy notes, maybe hints of peat?\nTaste\n85\n85\nThe arrival is citrusy and peppery, still kicking after so many years in the cask, and more than a decade in glass afterwards. The mouthfeel is light and a bit thin as you would expect from a low abv. Wood notes appear after a few seconds in the mouth, getting a bit overpowering as you keep the liquid on your tongue before swallowing. The bitterness of the wood is joined by a fruity bitterness too, with… bitter orange marmalade and the white part of grapefruit between the fruit itself and its peel. The leather is back, with the inside of an old tanned leather strap and turpentine again.\nFinish\n86\n86\nIt’s a melting pot of the notes from the nose and the palate, as the finish is hot with citrus notes, white pepper, wood again and turpentine, for a good length.', '58 years but not at all over oaked.

After about 45 minutes everything is beginning to open up, the spirit is settling, the sherry is stabilising and the wood is transforming. Theres definite grapefruits now with apples, cherries and oranges, mixed with [the still slightly putrid] clotted cream peat, which plays see-saw with the sherry oaked malt.

Well worth the wait.\nT: Thats a well married whisky, the sherry wood and spirit form a balanced soup with good density and covering on the palate and a fine bitter-sweet interplay between sherry and cask. Bitter wood pepper sprinkles herald the finish. As the malt opens up it has become more of a sugary sweet affair with the oak playing a supporting role. The sherry has really integrated now as the spirit really starts to talk and that millionaires chocolate [orange] tart keeps calling.

Maybe a Bowmore from 1970 because there are not that many 1969-71 Islay vintages out there at all because of a severe drought that hit Western Scotland during that time (yes, there were long-lasting droughts even before the climate change headlines). Islay was hit very hard by that drought and most distillery water sources fell dry - except Bowmore. Hence Bowmore seems to be the only Islay distillery which was able to distill (at least partly) throughout this period...\n\n...and this was not a bad period for Bowmore, not at all! This dram displays the flabbergasting Bowmore profile despite heavy sherry impact that would have killed most other spirits. But Bowmore is able to fight back and as a result there is a powerful dram which is not the most complex and delicate Bowmore of that time but certainly very impressive.\n\n[March, 2017]  There were several different releases of a 3x-years old 1970 Bowmore from Signatory and this one is the weakest of all (but still on a high quality level).  I bought this bottle no. 291 for 378 Euro in February 2009.\n\nThe heavy sherry is dominating the whisky and of all the trademark Bowmore flavours the blackcurrent aromas are over-powering all the rest.  Do not get me wrong, this is very interesting and if you drink such a dram for the first time you will be stunned.  But if you have experienced the other releases that are by far more complex, balanced and therefore delicate you will find this maybe nice at the first sip, but after a while it gets a little boring (hey, what am I writing - this is an old Bowmore and a very delicious dram indeed...).\n\nDo not use water as this will flatten the dram without releasing  significant new aromas.  And the finish turns bitter which happens often with these heavily sherried malts.  It is best when neat with all its power and spikes. \n\nA real must try but I would not go for two drams during an evening. My score back in March, 2017 was 88 (nose), 90 (taste) and 88 (finish).\nNose\n92\n92\nThe colour is burnished and the nose offers a powerful sherry-wooden-blackcurrant profile with all three dimensions fighting for dominance but no one wins, luckily. There are adorable OBFs (nail varnish remover) joining in quickly which team up with the sweet fruity aromas in their battle with the sour winey and bitter wooden impressions. I like that! After some breathing the battle calms down and it seems as if the combatants negotiated a ceasefire. Actually, the balance of this nose improves greatly upon oxidation. This is worth some 3-4 points in my book and that is why one should always have patience with drams, the older they are the more they demand. Obviously, I did not wait long enough when I scored this nose much lower several years ago.\nTaste\n91\n91\nThe taste is nicely layered starting on the sweet and sour winey notes but the bitter-spicy woods balance this out quickly. The malt takes its time until it shows up but than it delivers an impressive performance. The trademark Bowmore fruits (currants, passion fruits) join the sherry fruits (oranges, plums) to create an adorable fruit salad topped with a spicy sauce of molten barley sugars. The wood injects bitter tannins from time to time to contain the sweetness somewhat and to add different impressions as does the peat. No flaw or off-note and despite some layers may not be balanced the overall impression is that of a harmonic taste.\nFinish\n90\n90\nThe initial mouthfeel is quite hot for 51.3% abv but this vanishes quickly and a warming texture covers all of the mouth instead. The finish is long and provides more of an impression of an amalgam of all the different flavours, it is hard to catch single aromas here. I do not find the bitterness I described in my notes from March, 2017 - maybe I was somewhat tired or stressed back then and my taste buds reacted more sensitive to the tannins. Tonight I find the wood very appropriate and without any bitter-astringent moments at all. It dries out a little towards the end but this is fine with such a sherry maturation. There is a minor cardboardy moment at the very end, too.

Some say it was a mistake… If it’s true, some mistakes have very happy outcomes! Colour: orange – bronze (don’t worry, it’s not plain green). Nose: powerful, starting on raisins (sultanas but also Smyrna) and candy sugar. It’s not hugely rich (especially after the 1965 and despite the long pause). Unusual notes of candied citrons and apricots, seaweed (really), lemon-flavoured yoghurt, coconut (is that Springbank or the rum?) The sultanas grow even bolder after a moment, it gets also a little like a marc… Do I like it? Yes, it’s fabulous, even if a little confusing at the start. Mouth: now it’s thick and fat, almost greasy. Lots of nuts, olive oil, sultanas (of course), prunes… It’s not hot but very warming! Crystallised oranges, kumquats, and pineapple, coconut milk, blackcurrant jelly, light caramel, barley water, sugar cane cordial… Amazing! Gets then minty and camphory just like the 1965… And the finish, even if not as long as the 1965’s, is still pretty long, sweeter, more civilized and jammier (lots of oranges).

That's one of the reasons for my unusually high score, that this malt is not just uncommonly complex but highly entertaining too.\nNose\nThe style in this one is oily, leathery weirdness like a saddlebag full of old tools. There is a perfume-y twist to the 2004 that makes the nose more 'full' or pungent than the 2006. It reminds me of an incense shop or some scent that would be marketed with a bullshit bingo of orientalism. Adding some water makes it disappear. This one's as deeply pounding on the wonderful peatiness as the 2006 but maybe a little 'wider'. There is some tropical fruit (mango?) in the background that is absolutely delicious, a juicy sugary note balancing the leathery turfiness.  \nTaste\nFirst I thought I gave it too much water already because it took a while to develop into full form on the tongue. This peat burn that comes in late is  immense. It just stands right up and punches the roof of the mouth with this astounding soot blast. Some carbon and bone dry old wood. The constantly repeated descriptor 'oily' is so very accurate here. It's the oil & grease that put everything together in the body. Unlike the oiliness of crappy blends which serves as insulation between you and the whisky's actual taste this just takes control of the entire mouth and distributes the power evenly across the palate, then helps it sink in. Less wax and more citrus and herbs than in 2006.\nFinish\nThis one needs quite a lot of water to open up but it has immense depth and power hiding in it.

There is something unique about the Brora profile that I have never found in any other whisky. Some people say it is the farmy notes, dung etc ( in a good way). I got the farmy notes this time and possibly the dung but with Brora I never truly know what to call these farmy notes. I think in the mix is the peat and smoke but there is something else that I have trouble describing to be honest.\nThis is a whisky to be savoured that is for sure and I am not convinced that my palate is tuned enough to take everything in.\nDo I like this , oh yes certainly. It probably has just slightly to much peat for me but it is very refined for such a high strength whisky and the level of peat probably adds to the sweetness and compliments it nicely.\nIn summary, an excellent Brora and a whisky you would be hard pushed to better from any distillery .

White pepper too, as well as salt. The f2f is very interesting here, because if the two aromatic profiles are finally very close, they express themselves differently.

Nose: it’s absolutely thrilling to compare this baby with the young 1969, because beyond many similarities, there are also obvious differences that may have come from longer ageing in wood, although I wouldn’t say this is clearly more mature or older. So it’s globally drier, more herbal, more tertiary which is logical (metal polish, shoe polish, mushrooms, humus), and then much more mentholated and cigar-like. Newly opened box of habanos, toasted farmhouse bread, mandarin liqueur, tobacco smoke... It’s a kind of profile that I really cherish, it’s absolutely wonderful and not without reminding me of some old Macallans. BTW, you may expect a string of very old Macallans on WF in a few weeks... I say no more. Mouth: pah pah pah… It’s so unusual! Sure the oak’s louder than in the 1969 but this mentholated symphony is utterly amazing. If this doesn't get yer tongue a flappin' then you're already dead ;-). Please call the anti-maltoporn brigade! Finish: long and, granted, a little oakier (strong tea) but who cares, at 40 years old?

No heaviness whatsoever. Mouth: sweet but nervous, much more ‘virulent’ than expected. Lots happening in your mouth! Granted, it’s less complex than on the nose, as almost always with very old malts, but the sherry is superb and comes with ‘arranged’ rum (like pineapple-infused rum), bananas flambéed, cake, sultanas again but also very ripe strawberries – even black cherries -, toffee, and notes of icing sugar that makes the whole very lively.

And may all who are infected convalesce quickly and recover completely.\n\nIf you still think Corona is a fake I can assure you: It is not! I contracted the virus during its early days in March and luckily I managed to get through this without any major symptoms except a complete loss of my smell and taste for more than five days (it was really spooky to not smell nothing out of a Laphroaig bottle). But given the enormous size of my lymph nodes around the neck during the infection I can easily imagine that things start to get really bad once the virus manages to overwhelm this barrier and enters the inner body. So please take Corona seriously even if you own a strong immune system and do not drink too much alcohol these days (alcohol blocks the immune system from working properly)...\n\n...rather have a smaller but excellent dram like this one. This is great stuff from the past and given all the changes in the whisky industry since 1956 I doubt such a style of whisky is replicable again. So savour every drop and enjoy every moment, and stay healthy!\n\n[January, 2019] After I finished last year with a very old grain I have to start the new year with an even older malt, for sure...\n\n...and this was a great decision! This is a perfect matured old style sherried whisky of the finest kind with strong but never dominating wooden notes because all other flavours (both sherry- and malt-induced) hold their heads up high. This is a bold and impressive dram both for nosing and sipping.\nNose\n93\n93\nThe colour is very dark at old oak and the nose offers a complex and delicate old style sherry profile of the finest kind with lots of adorable OBFs (old bottle flavours). This for sure was one of these heavily sherry-soaked casks that contained the sweet wine for years (not just weeks like today) so it provides lots of maturation support to even third or fourth fillings. The wood is absolutely okay in this nose and provides a firm but not dominating framework for both the malt and sherry aromas. Hey, this is nicely balanced and absolutely adorable - I could sniff this for hours.\nTaste\n93\n93\nThe taste is truly multi-layered on sweet oloroso flavours (fruits, chocolates) first closely followed by bitter tannins and herbs from the wood. But the malt counters this with another wave of molten barley sugars and honeys before the spices and nuts kick in. The bitter tannins do their best to keep the enormous sweetness under control but luckily they do not succeed in this fight over dominance. This is all pretty balanced despite the battle that rages on my taste buds. I really, really love this back and forth of different flavours - it feels like ""Braveheart"" fights on my tongue.\nFinish\n92\n92\nThe initial mouthfeel is warming and instantly coating with significant but still bearable bitter-astringent moments from the tannins. But these are nicely contained by the enormous creamy and sweet moments of the sherry, actually I like this combo of two extremes. The finish is long and gets smoother compared to the wild taste as if the combatants are tired and negotiated a cease-fire. The bitter-astringent note stays until the very end but this is absolutely okay for a 50-years old malt and not distracting at all (because all other flavours are that strong, still). Forget about water because all these interesting and enjoyable battles of the flavours end instantly in the reduced dram - this whisky is perfect when neat.', 'Nose\n91\n91\nTaste\n95\n95\nFinish\n97\n97', 'The nose and the finish are outstanding, the taste of the malt unfortunately can not quite keep up.

Really, really tasty.\nTaste\nOn the palate now the barrel influence clearly present, but without this would have killed the malt. The red fruits, the forest honey and the sweet sherry notes are still present, now complemented by a slight oak note. This ensures a slight bitterness, which fortunately is somewhat dampened by sherry. Not quite as good as hoped, unfortunately. The outstanding impression of the nose, the malt can unfortunately not continue here.\nFinish\nLong, sweet, yummy. Right, really strong.

It's just a knockout grade, so you do not have to drink anymore! What? Attack: Easy to hit, but feeling with a hard feeling.Woody with sorrow Body: Middleweight of concentration and reduction.Taste: Nuance of wooden houses on rainy day is the best. A subtle dried fruit woody is unique only with Longmorn.Dry dry strawberries and flower fruits keep the health, calm adult nuances.Shimo-like, shiitake-like like soup like Japanese soup stock If there is astringent, fruity with gumi (茱萸) and cherry 's dynamism feeling! But there is no plum. Apart from Longmorn, you do not have to feel plum! What? Forcing the taste is a big objection, how much you scream himself! While saying that, the nuance of apricots pickled in apricots and apple seems to be Longmorn like this one, and it has a moderately aged Oban taste. (Of course Oban is Oh Chang in Japanese, not Distillery's Oban. ) Fiinish: It is good that the feeling that the grape candy goes out of the store is going to disappear shortly for a while, it is western rather than Japanese.It is like that it is a masterpiece that is not Kotteri Munmun system, that is, it seems like Glenugie There is no fascination of magic, but after all, Longmorn is dying! https://whisky2010.usukeba.com/u/whisky2010/1fyhars7pvryw4"", 'Nose\n93\n93\nTaste\n93\n93\nFinish\n90\n90', ""Tasting Notes from Serge V. (Whiskyfun.com, 27/01/2014):\n\nColour: full amber.\n\nNose: the digestif will win it, no doubt about that and that was to be expected. It's one of these stunning old-style Longmorns that were fatter and oilier than more modern offerings. Stunning nose, full of beeswax, old turpentine, apricot jam, earthy pu-erh tea, pipe tobacco, metal polish, date wine, chocolate liqueur, mushrooms, old balsamic vinegar... All this is really stunning. With water: even more so. A box of puros from Cuba's best factory. And I'm very fond of these touches of parsley in the background.\n\nMouth (neat): this is liquid honey blended with limejuice and a whole bottle of prohibition-time cough syrup (I imagine). Totally exceptional whisky, I especially adore these sherry monsters that show great balance because of a zesty/tarty side. With water: well, maybe it's time to call the anti-maltoporn brigade. Please...\n\nFinish: long, more on orange liqueurs and old Sauternes from a great year. There's something slightly muscaty as well, and some mint, and some liquorice...\n\nComments: extremely impressive, some of these old Longmorns were simply unbeatable.

Typical assortment of raisins, cooked fruits (strawberries, blackcurrants, blackberries) and flowers (peonies or some orchids) but it’s really too powerful, water is needed. With water: a fantastic vinosity! Winey notes can be a problem in whisky but it’s all pleasure here. Old high-end Sauterne (I had old Raymond-Lafons that smelled almost exactly like this Miltonduff), overripe apricots, quinces, dried pears, dried longans… Add to that a little tar and a little ginger for good measure as well as hints of chives and parsley (and soy sauce) and you get a fab ‘sherried’ nose. Mouth (neat): extremely thick, rich and concentrated but absolutely not cloying or too fat. Just too powerful to be enjoyed when undiluted… So, with water: all in keeping with the nose!

Glenglassaugh 40-year-old,93.01,81,"['1551) Glenglassaugh, 40YO (2013)\nA special gift from a fellow dram-er that I tucks away safely in the cabinet for few years. A staggering 40YO from a remote coastal distillery.\nNose\nN- After 40years of slow nurturing in the casks, this one need times and patience to let it breath to reach fullness in the glass. Stiff and restricts at the beginning as anticipated, but affection grows with the arrival of natural fine dates and raisins oak fragrant. Strawberry fondant, semi moist coarse sugar coated dehydrated nutmeg and apricot, bright liquorice shines at tail. (93/23)\nTaste\nP- Pronounce oak influence the liquid with doses of black tea, tannin, berries compote with floral essence. Lightly bitterly sweet transit to mellow sourness, and feel more of coffee bean now than black tea. (89/22)\nFinish\nF- Medium, feel the lack of stamina here. Smooth with substances, chewy ripe tannin without the bites. Age-y dry elegantly. (87/21)\n\nB/B- 87/21 Perhaps, weakened by the strength. I can imagine I will scores this lower on a blind tasting and not knowing is 40YO.\n\nWeighted Rate- 88pt, +1 for old malt.', 'Nose\n94\n94\nTaste\n92\n92\nFinish\n95\n95', 'Appearance: Deep gold.\n\nNose: Olorosso in perfectly aged oak beckons: there are Medjool dates, maple walnut ice cream, bananas foster, cracked old leather-bound books, hints of violet–which come and go–raspberries, malted milk balls, an impression of sealing wax…and, last but not least, a phantom note of whole cluster Pinot noir grapes dried in the bottom of a wine glass.\n\nPalate: Delicate syrups roll over the tongue without feeling oily, almost as though it evaporates in media res. However, there is no alcohol burn. To say this dram is smooth would be something of an understatement. I love how the marriage between oak, whisky, and sherry has been consummated over forty long years–a “beckoning fair one,” indeed.\n\nThe Oloroso influence seems rather dry in the mouth, evoking jammy figs, apricots, plums, rhubarb. Macadamia nuts are cradled by a ubiquitous yet unimposing oak foundation, which isn’t bitter in the least. The sample in my glass is three quarters gone now. As my mouth and brain have grown accustomed to the broth, I’m happy to report lightly roasted coffee beans, along with Abuelita Mexican hot chocolate. There even seems to be a touch of steamed rice milk with almond syrup. Marvelous, just marvelous.\n\nFinish: Well, the denouement is not what I would call long. In fact, this whisky’s finish is barely medium in length. But a woody-marshmallowy-sweet impression haunts the mouth in the best of ways. I might also add that my dram is really “neat.” By this, I mean to say that a light sprinkling of water does nothing to improve the quality, the depth, or the complexity. Rallfy Mitchell might disagree, with teaspoon in hand, but I really must hold my ground. Lovely stuff–this–at full strength, thank you very much.\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI suppose the main drawback to this Glenglassaugh 40-Year-Old lies in the fact that it doesn’t present much in the way of a challenge. It’s exceedingly agreeable, smooth, and civilized. The finish is medium-short, and sweet as pie. I’ve read about previous 40-year-olds, released by Glenglassaugh, that sounded far more complex, offering everything from hints of metal polish to pineapple glazed ham.\n\nIn other words, there are no savory or industrial influences in this 42.5% bottling. If I were angling to spend upwards of $1,300 on a whisky, I might want a bit more in the way of a challenge. But that’s me. I’m sure that plenty of folks with pockets that deep would rather just sip a delicious dram and think about other things. (Speaking of which . . . in my review of the Springbank 16-Year-Old Local Barley, you will find a discussion of forty-plus-year-old Springbank releases that contain both savory and industrial notes, by the way.)\n\nI also find it interesting that the Glenglassaugh 40-Year-Old is quite a bit lighter in color than the 30-Year-Old. I guess the younger spirit hails from casks with more sherry left in the wood? Darker isn’t always better, however. That’s worth remembering, especially in a very old spirit that has been allowed to retain a decent amount of distillery character.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Glenglassaugh has released two batches of venerable old single malts. The first batch includes eight whiskies that range from 28 to 45 years old. The second batch also consists of eight releases, this bunch ranging from 36-42 years old. All of them are reputed to be “fruit bombs.” I didn’t see anything on Glenglassaugh’s website, or in any related whisky reviews online, which pointed to much in the way of savory notes, spicy notes, or industrial notes.\n\nFor a distillery that died and came back from the dead more times than I can count, Glenglassaugh sure created a lot of well mannered “offspring.” I’m sure that these bottled spirits are more than happy to “speak their names,” if one holds a glass to one’s ear. They have all the charm of the Belle at the Ball, rather than the Bad Boy who was mothballed.\n\nAs for the secret history of an “undead” distillery, I’m relieved to say that this yarn has a happy ending, thanks to Benriach. Slainte mhath. May the river, the tide, and good spirits, rise with you. I have yet to try any of the younger NAS core offerings, but they seem intriguing. Perhaps one or two might stray into the realm of spicy, savory, and industrial.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m a sucker for older age statement whiskies that cover all three bases, and then tag home plate (sweet). For me, that sort of complexity is a Babe Ruth-style home run, at least when it’s done right. Judging by the reviews I’ve seen of the discontinued 40 Year Old 44.6% offering, that seems to have been the case. The darkly dangerous broth is rumored to contain spices, smoked meats, and plenty of succulent fruits, as well as chocolaty goodness. Ah, well. The grass is always greener. Especially when the late great Jim Murray tantalizes you with 96 points from beyond the grave. That’s right.

This profile of whisky feels so unique and other worldly, as it's so rarely found. The soft and restrained peat gracefully weaves through the topical fruit and funky minerals, with the smoke evoking a mixture of farmyard and seashore landscapes.

It's almost surreal to taste a whisky that was distilled in 1938.\nNose\n93\n93\nIt needs many minutes in the glass. At first, something leathery or an old book, maybe even wax, is completely in the nose and does not allow any further perceptions. He seems very closed. Then it opens...\n\nAfter some time intense wood aromas come through, old wood. It is old wood, like smelling a fallen, wet and broken tree in the forest that has been lying there for many months or even years. You can literally sense in your nose that you are dealing with something old. It smells so venerable and so completely different from what is known from modern distillates. I detect a hint of vanilla bean. It's a whole vanilla pod that you hold to your nose before preparing it. There are also dark fruits, but above all a spiciness from herbs.\n\nThe nose is so deep and complex that you don't want to stop smelling it. The glass continues to carry those great notes throughout the evening, long after the contents have been emptied. I haven't experienced that before. I don't even notice an alcoholic note.\nTaste\n93\n93\nIntense wood dominates. It accompanies the dram in a very dominant and intense, but very enjoyable way. I have never before perceived such an intense wood as so great and not disturbing. It's just gorgeous. The whisky is smooth and mild. Minimal vanilla comes through, like trying chopped vanilla bean neat. I hardly notice the alcohol at all. Perhaps there is a minimal tingling of sharpness.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe departure is the real sensation. If you no longer have the whisky in your mouth, it continues to build up.

And please remember: Whisky was rather made for drinking than for herding...', 'Talisker 55 50.4%\n\nNose- Red fruit, sea breeze, gentle and deep at the same time, citrus, a light note of herbs, all accompanied by salt,\n\nTaste - as in the smell, more fruit, mineral,\n\nFinish - long, oak, dry, light red fruit, wet salty stones.', ""Talisker 1955 GM 50.4% [WB: 23839] vs Talisker 1955 GM 53.6% [WB: 7511]\nThe left glass is 50.4% strong, and the right glass is 53.6%. After pouring it, you can see that the whisky in the left glass is a tone lighter. Which does not change the fact that both are relatively clear. It certainly has nothing to do with the currently fashionable color :)\nIn the right glass the smell is definitely more volatile. I would even say that the left one seems muffled at first. At the first contact, red fruit and sea climates are delusional in both. Definitely dignified and deep.\n\nNOSE: 50.4% ripe red fruit, seafood sauce, mint? citrus? (feeling of refreshingly refreshing nose). The sweetness is mixed with the sea, showing the ripe apple peel every now and then, and after a while we are transported to the breeze of the sea, to return to the orchard with a plate full of mussels, herbs and citrus. Definitely pleasant, though gentle and unobtrusive. You can say dignified :) Cherry syrup with herbs. Incredible. An hour has passed.\nIn the meantime, comparisons to the 53.6% version continue. The smell hits a few (teen?) Centimeters from the glass. It is powerful, full and round. Everything in the left glass, but stronger, more specific (cleaner and dirtier at the same time !?). Ripe red fruit, warmed up on the warmest day of summer, a fishing boat filled with fresh seafood flows by. Where does this smell of dried (?) Plums come from? I think they stayed in the pocket of the leather jacket. There must be something refreshing on such a warm day - lemon peel and grapefruit pulp fit perfectly. Cherry, maybe a cherry stone?\nDespite 20 minutes of continuous smelling, minerality / smoke does not disappear, what's more, it changes: it is cutter, then fish, sea, salty, mineral. Tarry at no time.\nI go back to the left glass (50.4%) - definitely more delicate, you have to put your nose deeper into the glass. However, this does not change the fact that the fragrance is incredibly dignified and deep. A lot of sweetness, but the citrus versus that balances it wonderfully. There are also glimpses of skin and nuts. In an empty glass, dried plums, cherries in chocolate, skin.\n53.6% - there are also caramel aromas and sweet candies. Amazing whisky.\n\nTaste: 50.4% - light fruitiness quickly gives way to dried notes, bitter cocoa, to return to red fruit (prunes), cherries. Delicate minerality. Grapefruit peel.\n53.6% - no words. The taste definitely preserves what's in the nose. Red fruit, sweetness, sea, seafood, slight tartness. Sweetness, menthol ... Austerity may be a disadvantage, but certainly not here - sweetness and smokiness contrast beautifully, joining in a common dance - the finish.\n\nFinish: 50.4% - long, dry, dry. Slightly mineral, the nuance of the taste remains - red fruit.\n53.6% - long, delicate tartness. It delicately dries out, smells indefinite red fruit, sweetness and a slight smoke (more dried fruit?).\n\nBottom line: The 53.6% version is better in every aspect and just as 50.4% is a brilliant whisky that seems to be the dream of every whisky lover, 53.6% is a godsend. As of today (10/07/2021) it is ahead of all the whisky I have tried by two lengths.\nTalisker 1955 GM 50.4% My grade: 8- / 10 -> 94/100\nTalisker 1955 GM 53.6% - practically ideal 10/10 -> 98/100"", 'red ripe apples, peaches, delicate sea and minerality in the background', 'This is really good.

That was explicitly highlighting the ‘old school distillery profile / characteristics” of the malt, focusing on the typical Bowmore fruitiness driven by exotic fruits in a lead with mango, grapefruit and passion fruit. Since this moment something special was triggered and since then I’m hunting for this type of Bowmore’s. After a few unique IB’s I went further and further and at the end I’ve seen the best of best’s in this category, like the Holy Grail’s. This contains only a few Bowmore’s: of course No.1 with the legendary Samaroli Bouquet, Prestonfield 1972 and the Sea Dragon.

Old, super-fruity Bowmore flavors. Astonishingly similar to Jim McEwan\'s ""Islay Trinity"" (MMD) bottling, at least as far as the flavors are concerned, our Bowmore offers a tender potpourri of tropical fruits, Galia melons, ripe mangos, limes, the finest fruit bomb, the distillate\'s old bowmoor style I\'ve always loved the 1960s and do it again today - a scent to kneel down without ever seeming or overly artificial.\nTaste\nRound, soft, velvety. Roll in perfectly. It does not scratch, bite or sting anything. Nice, elegant drinking level. The alcohol content of 43% ABV is for my taste for this large, mature Malt consistent and above all absolutely sufficient, if you get involved in the malt and its variety of flavors. At the turn of the millennium cask strength was still far less popular and widespread than it is today. The taste immediately follows the hoped fruit cocktail. Interestingly, however, kiwis, which I do not have in my nose, give the malt an extremely fresh, almost ""juicy"" touch, which, however, has nothing to do with the special, very characteristic citrus component of many old Ardbegs. Oak spice, slightly tame smoke and a ripe, oaky bitterness, which never seems unpleasant, but rather opens up a further dimension of taste, which offers here the congenial counterpart to the sweet, tropical fruitiness.\nFinish\nThe finish is not as long and stunning as on a Bowmore 30th Anniversary - the comparison is inherently age-related - but still great. A comparison at an extremely high level. Towards the end, there are more smoky notes, some of which I almost associate with charred pieces of wood rather than peat.', '[July, 2017]  At the birthday of a very good friend I opened another bottle of this delicious stuff and it emptied at a dangerous speed, what else?  These bottles were sold for 180 Euro (350 Deutschmark) around the year 2000 so the whisky was distilled in the glory sixties (the best period of Bowmore).\n\nSimply great stuff from the past - but always remember there were quite a lot of different batches of this 30 year old sea dragon.  They are all great but - of course - different.  This batch is one of the best I had so far (unfortunately there is no chance to identify the different batches before opening the bottle and tasting it - one of the main differentiating factors is the colour)...\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is russetmuscat and the texture shows the characteristics of a great spirit: slow legs and late fat sticky tears.

I can sniff such stuff for hours...\nTaste\n92\n92\nThe taste offers this tropical fruit market again and is amazingly fresh and powerful. One to chew for minutes.

Ardbeg 1966 MI,93.0,22,"['My favourite of the three birds great sherried ardbeg, leathe, tobacco, varnish, dark fruits, brilliant', '95', '[February, 2019] Life is too short to let the great drams of this world pass un-tasted - that is why I traded two full bottles of Ardbeg 1978 for samples of all three Moon ""Birds"" bottlings of vintage 1966. Now I am able to do a head-to-head of this fine dram from cask 348 versus its siblings from cask 2443 (WB id 8670) and cask 2445 (WB id 8671). Later I will do a detailed review of each dram in additional sessions (but just one per day).\n\nWow, this was a flabbergasting experience! All three are truly excellent old Traditional Scotch maturations that offer the fine sixties profile of Ardbeg at its best. Overall, cask 2443 is the best of the pack closely followed by cask 348 while cask 2245 falls a little behind (but still on a very high quality level). I really look forward to my single tasting sessions with a fresh and clean palate...\nNose\n94\n94\nThe colour of cask 43 is amber while cask 45 is one shade paler at old gold and cask 48 is very dark at mahogany. The first noses right after serving are not very impressive and rather shy (but the empty sample bottles smell rich and complex due to their much smaller volumes than the big glasses) so I let the drams breathe for around thirty minutes which is the minimum oxidation time required according to a friend that tried them before (please do not forget to cover the glass during that time).\nAfter fifteen minutes the noses still are rather shy but delicate and complex with the 43 offering a peaty-fruity-herbal profile, the 45 is about the same but shows more herbs and less fruits while the 48 owns a dry sherry-tarry-spicy profile. After thirty minutes the noses of all three drams opened up greatly (as promised) and offer a much bolder nosing experience with many additional aromas released.\nThe 43 offers more waxy, mineral, tarry and cigar smokey notes, the 45 added grassy-autumn floral, fruity, eucalyptus and chalky aromas while the 48 got leathery, medicinal, fruity and nutty. I like the 48 best followed by the 43 and than the 45. By the way, a longer oxidation than thirty minutes does not improve the noses further.\nTaste\n94\n94\nThe taste of the 43 is multi-layered and highly complex on basically the same profile as was the nose. After some chewing additional maritime and honey-sugary flavours pop up that nicely complement this excellent taste. The 45 offers a layered and complex taste too, but it is not as sophisticated as the 43. There are some fine additional oily (olives) and ashy flavours and after some chewing molten sugars and milk chocolatey notes pop up. The sherry profile of the 48 is quite drying and interestingly medicinal-leathery (remember the old leather bags of country docs?). Salmiak drops, tar and some maritime flavours join later, all very tasty. I prefer the 43 a little over the 48 but even the 45 is on a very high level too, no doubt.\nSome drops of water release additional aromas and flavours both with the 43 and 45 but it turns the 48 unpleasantly bitter like so often with old heavily sherried drams. I like the 43 and 45 best at around 43% abv and the 48 neat, of course.\nFinish\n92\n92\nThe initial mouthfeel of the 43 is warming and charming with a nice coating effect and no distracting moments. The 45 arrives with about the same feeling on the palate but with a minor drying moment that is not distracting. The mouthfeel of the 48 is more powerful and impressive but with a minor bitter-astringent moment (tannins).\nThe finish of the 43 is long and gets a little salty and ashy which turns the end somewhat drying (but this is rather enjoyable). The finish of the 45 turns even more herbal-bitter with a short fruity flash at the end that I really like. Again there is a minor drying feeling (cold ashes) that is not distracting. The 48 finishes a little shorter than the other two but with adorable chocolatey and more smokey-leathery notes than were in the taste. The tannins provide a slightly bitter-drying end to this fine dram. Here I like the 43 best followed by the 45 and 48.', 'Tasting note by Serge Valentin\n\nArdbeg 1966/1987 (46%, Moon Import, The Birds, sherry hogshead, cask #348, 360 bottles) Five stars Cask #2443 by the same bottlers was superb (WF 93) but I never tried cask #348. Now’s the time. Colour: mahogany. Nose: it’s rather quieter than the Bowmore at first nosing, quite astonishingly, maybe because there’s a lot of dry sherry that tames the malt. Having said that, the whole never stops developing after one or two minutes, all on roasted nuts, tar, old orange liqueurs, old balsamic vinegar, cured ham and camphor. Then more chestnut liqueur, mint, ginger and a little coffee. The other 1966 by Moon had much less sherry if I remember well, but this one is stunning anyway. Utterly stunning. No water. More tar. Mouth: well, it’s very big but it’s also a little drying in the attack (a little too much cinnamon/cardboard) while there’re also bags of liquorice and tar as well as something very medicinal. Salmiak, kippers, molasses, roasted peanuts, melon liqueur. Gets then saltier and brinier, with also hints of lime and cough drops. Excellent – should I add of course – but a tad roughish and too dry. Also ‘a taste of gasoline’. Finish: long, dry, smokier. More cough syrup and a leathery aftertaste. Comments: a very big Ardbeg from the 1960s – while others were rather rounder and more approachable. It’s a superb whisky, but other old Ardbegs (most from the 1970s) have been even more superb in my book.

Here you do not have to think for long and brood for associations. The smell is about as intense as having the fruit under the nose. Pineapple and mandarin lead. In addition, the sweetness rising from a pan, when cinnamon sugar slowly melted. Unlike the 2014 Laphi Cairdeas not the idea of cinnamon, but the barley brandy in my Nosingglas smells of cinnamon and vanilla in full splendor. Added to this are grapefruit, pickled plums and roasted almonds. The sugary sweetness turns after a few minutes of extensive taster to different honey notes. A touch of acetone, but rather contributes to the fact that the malt wins complexity, as to harm him. It\'s just terrific.

The acidity turns into varnish with aeration. Slightly camphorated black tea on the great inspirations. It becomes more and more fresh in contact with the air.\nTaste\nPowerful, intense palate.

This is among the best old Longmorn profiles I tasted so far, and certainly one of the best bottlings of TWA. Congrats to this selection, Carsten!\n\nPS: Not just the prices increased dramtically over the last ten years but average scores of (some) whisky bloggers too, e.g. Serge rated this dram just 90 points back in 2010.\nNose\n96\n96\nThe colour is russetmuscat and the nose is simply adorable. A perfect old-style sherry profile enfolds with all delicious aromas present one can imagine. Dozens of different fruits (fresh and dried, exotic and home-grown), nuts, leather, waxes, herbs, spices and many more impressions flood my olfactory cells. After some breathing interesting notes of OBFs (furniture polish) and green tea join in while the fruits retreat somewhat. I could sniff this for hours and it greatly opens up with even more aromas upon breathing - I suggest to use a big spherical blender's glass and to take at least 30 minutes for the nosing exercise, better more.\nTaste\n95\n95\nThe taste is multi-layered on all the fine flavours which appeared in the nose already and they march across my taste buds as if they celebrate a victory parade. Not a single off-note or imbalance that I can detect but many delightful flavours. New fruits pop up, among them such strange ones like quinces or figs which are rather rare to find in malt whisky. This is an excellent and complex taste which is both interesting to explore and tasty to sip.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe arrival on my palate is charming with a creamy, warming texture coating all of my mouth instantly and without any distracting moments. The finish is long and adds more nutty (almonds) and chocolatey impressions. The wood turns stronger towards the end but never gets out of control, this dram keeps its fine balance until the very end. Some water releases (even) more aromas in the nose and flavours on the palate - I like this dram best a little reduced to about 48% abv. A further reduction intermingles the layers (like so often)."", 'A filigree Longmorn with a lot of depth.

Certainly some aniseed and dill as well. Then it's rather citrus and liquorice wood, then vin jaune or manzanilla (yes, fresh walnuts), a side that never stops growing over time. It's actually very restless, it never stops changing, which is both fabulous and a drawback if you want to write tasting notes... Aaargh! Also wee touches of paint thinner (high quality paint thinner, of course), creosote, a new box of cigars, various oils and waxes, touches of turpentine, overripe apples, teak oil... Oh and there, it changes again, becoming much more coastal and almost as smoky as a youngster. Bonfire, oysters and such. Phew, this baby really shakes you off!\n\nWith water: no huge changes, let's say it became fresher and a wee notch more medicinal. Lemon juice with a few drops of antiseptic.

Mouth (neat): the oak feels a bit (astringency) but only for fraction of a second, because lemons, smokes and especially lapsang-souchong tea are soon to come to the rescue. I think we're really in the world of tea here, it's sharing many similarities with an old pu-erh, the soft kind of woodiness (incense once again, sandalwood, 'sweet' cinnamon), the mild fruitiness around kumquats and dried papayas, the earthy smokiness... Then there's some honeydew, lemon pie, a faint camphory touch, certainly some cough syrup 'as always', some black chocolate, oysters, lemon balm... We're experiencing the same phenomenon as on the nose, it keeps changing. Oh, and there are lovely touches of ripe melon. With water: same development as with the nose, let's keep this as short as possible, we're not writing a (poor) novel, are we! Finish: the oak's back and we're rather on black tea and cocoa powder. Dry aftertaste. Comments: this one is extremely difficult to score, since a. it doesn't stop changing and b. the taster can lose his marks, which is a consequence of a. I certainly did sometimes. So a brilliantly challenging whisky, I'd say, it's sometimes almost like playing chess against Kasparov (I imagine).

In the background, a fruity note is directly noticeable. Yellow, almost too light fruits for his age fill the glass. A beguiling fragrance of white and red peaches and not too ripe mangos. The abrasion of an orange peel and a few mint leaves offer the yellow fruits contraindications and together form a nice balance. In addition to the light fruits, a touch of caramel and warm honey nestles, beeswax comes out. With a bit of time in the glass, the Lagavulin now also shows more of its strong and spicy side. Aromatic pipe tobacco, leather and dark chocolate complete the spicy side of the quite fresh malts. An insanely complex and full aroma.\nTaste\nAs soon as you have the whisky on your tongue, the experience goes on. One thinks the mouth explodes in a positive sense. Voluminous. The almost extinguished campfire fills up again and the embers give off their heat more and more. Warms the mouth, ashes on the tongue. The honey from the aroma drips on the tongue and gives the full, strong taste a slight sweetness. Now the orange peel from the aroma stimulates the salivation and the malt becomes oily as well as dry. Red pepper spreads from the tip of the tongue throughout the mouth. The 51% alcohol is perfect.\nFinish\nThe finish is long, full, spicy and warm. Glowing, he flows down the throat. Licorice, leather and coffee grounds dress the mouth and throat.

This has the Garioch stuff we love. Dank, mustardy, sooty (not sweep) and big iodine like peat.. HS305 is correct to compare this to some 67’ Ardbeg’s. A lot of parallels, especially with this old school rich sherry and iodine flavours. However for us Great Beg has more mesquite like peat while the Garioch peat is more earthy somewhere between Brora and Longrow. Old Ardbeg also usually has some slightly sweeter chlorophyll and citrus whilst this Garioch is just darker, drier, more farmy towards Brora but more ethereal perhaps. This Garioch for me was more reminiscent of some of the 1968 29y single casks with huge peat power and mustard seed and whilst a stunning and very powerful malt, for me it lacked a few elegant touches and depth of terroir flavours offered by Silvano Samaroli and his 75’ bottlings, especially those in Fino (12-15y) that really allowed the spirit to shine. If only Garioch could return to this kind of style though, sherry or otherwise…..how they would surely rule the world again. Thank you Dirk. You are a true whiskyman, the highest compliment I can give :)', 'Thank you hs305 for this fantastic evening. Slim Cowell Bottling #II, III and IV. This was certainly a benchmark to taste all three of them at the same time. It is so hard to believe that the whiskies are only 15yo. How is this possible? They all have a voluptuous full and mulitlayered body and taste. Interestingly #II drew comparisons to 1967 SV Ardbegs (28/30yo), #III to complex 70s Brora and #IV to 70s yellow fruity bourbon casked Bowmore. As hs305 was so meticulously taking notes which were discussed as well, I simply enjoyed and let him do the ""work"". An evening which will be very hard to top in which #II was at another level at 95 and #III and IV were at the same level for me so I won\'t set them apart and score them both at 94.', ""[April, 2022] With a little luck (to be honest, this is extremely big luck!) I managed to buy all three Slim Cowell's legendary Glen Garioch bottlings out of the estate of a deceased wine collector near Hamburg (where Slim Cowell ran his shop). So these bottles are genuine, for sure and together with good friends I do a somewhat decadent head-to-head tasting of all three Slim Cowell's Personal Selections II-IV tonight...\n\n...and these are all flabbergasting drams from one of the best periods of this (often) still undervalued distillery. The 1972 (II) is on eye-level with the best 60ies heavily sherried Ardbeg releases (e.g., 1967 SV dark oloroso) while the 1973 (III) compares rather to a mid-seventies Brora and the 1975 (IV) is more of the fruity kind like the mid-seventies bourbon-matured Bowmore.\n\nBy the way, this bottle was sold for as much as 45 Deutschmark (23 Euro) at Slim Cowell's Caledonian House shop in Hamburg in March, 1988. That is what I call a bargain!\nNose\n94\n94\nThe colour is quite dark at tawny and - of course - I use a big spherical blender's glass to nose this old beauty. The nose is very punchy at the first sniff (60% abv) and after my olfactory cells adopt to that a powerful and complex profile emerges. After some minutes of breathing this nose greatly opens up with dozens of different impressions to catch. Please refer to Serge for details, he is more skilled in identifying and naming all these rather unusual aromas (he cites cigars, antiseptic, camphor, then old pu-erh tea, dried kelp and je-ne-sais-quoi). To me this is an interesting amalgam of the medicinal notes of 70ies Ardbeg, the maritime notes of 70ies Talisker and waxy-oily notes of 70ies Brora. Sounds great? It is! The sherry aromas are rather shy but the wood is quite firm. Water opens up this nose further and I prefer to nose this dram at about 45% abv.\nTaste\n96\n96\nWow, the taste is ... 60ies heavy-sherried Ardbeg (like the famous 1967 SV dark oloroso bottlings) with all heavy peat, heavy sherry and firm woods in perfect balance. This is huge, complex, multi-layered, taste-bud charming and extremely quaffable. I guess there are more than 36 different flavours to detect over time. Water turns the dram smoother and releases tasty dark chocolatey flavours but the layers intermingle more so I prefer to investigate the taste neat and after that I like to sip it reduced to about 50% abv.\nFinish\n96\n96\nDespite the 60% abv the initial mouthfeel is not hot at all but offers a creamy, instantly coating texture without a single distracting moment. The finish is virtually endless with more adorable peat flavours (tarred road on a hot summer day, cold cigar) and more fruits (oranges, prunes) which is a tasty combo. Again there are no distracting moments at all and the wood is about perfect until the very end. Water turns the finish even more approachable and releases delicate crème brûlée flavours after it went down my throat. Legendary stuff, nothing else to say."", 'http://whiskywarehouse.blog.jp/archives/1062057788.html', 'Not sure if Serge ‘s bottle varied so differently to the one I tasted. I tasted Emmanuel Dron’s bottle at the Old & Rare show Feb2019. Its a good Glen Garioch but not very good and certainly not great. Lacked the complexity for me that serge found in his. Rather more linear on sherry fruits, resins and the cask dominated the finished whisky. Many of the 1970’s Samaroli bottlings in ex-fino and ex bourbon cask managed to retain a real balance of distillate, peat and cask sweetness. Some of the greatest whiskies ever bottled. This simply did not reach those heights. All sherry and was quite astringent and sappy in the finish. I think theres a lot of emotional ‘placebo’ scoring with such rare bottles as these which is why our club tastings are always blind.', ""SergeGlen Garioch Highland 15 yo 1972 (60%, Slim Cowell’s Personal Selection II, +/-1987) Bottled by owners Morrison-Howat for the excellent and much missed whisky enthusiast Slim Cowell.

Burning peat and cigars at first nosing, this is superb! It's well still from Glen Garioch's peaty times, it's almost Ardbeggy. No wonder, Slim Cowell was a fan of both Ardbeg and Glen Garioch.

With water: no no no, this is impossible. It couldn't have gotten even more entrancing. Mouth (neat): a blast!

More disturbing, however, is the oaky bitterness in the aftertaste. The malt is just a little over the top. Ten years less would probably have been much better. So it's still a good 87 points overall, but not enough for this price range.\n\nTasted on 21/10/2022 (Sample)\n\nMore notes and reviews on Facebook at: #Maltkanzlei"", 'A dream - complex sucking whisky for the wing chair that deserves the ball glass - almost perfect old-style sherry cracker - everything your heart desires\nNose\n95\n95\nwow !

All of this with surprisingly little sweetness, nor any bitterness but with earthy/tobacco notes in the foreground and a bit of spice along the way.

So to compensate, I kept one eye on myself whilst getting carried away with the other. As I understand it, we start with a double-vintage Ardbeg consisting of bourbon cask-matured juice from 1974 and sherry-matured juice from 1975, both years’ spirit made from Ardbeg’s old floor maltings.\n\nN: Certain OBE [sherry] vibes that translate as the most amazingly concentrated adult-only fruit juice.

Cracking!\nT: Compared to more contemporary peated drams [of which I’ve had a few this week], the peat here is decidedly light and integrated with the rich & gentile sherry oak, coupled with a sweet spicy saltiness. Subjectively, I began thinking of outdoor dusty markets – all sorts from every corner of the globe in fact – before focusing back to a floral aspect and an overall fragility [from the whisky].\nF: Long-yet-whispery sweet ashy sooty oaky fruitiness, and for the first time today, oiliness!\nC: Fabulous and emotional.

It’s all very classy and elegant\n\nPalate: Hugely fruity. Dark fruits, syrupy old school sherry sweetness. Smoke is there in the background, but it’s all faint and plays just a supporting role. Nutty oloroso, Demerara rum notes for sure. Incredibly deep and rich. \n\nFinish: Not a super long finish. Maduro tobacco, cedar, overripe dark fruits, dry nutty oloroso, with a faint whiff of smoke to end things. \n\nSummary: A beautiful malt to be sure. It’s honestly more of a throwback to what old sherry casks used to be, not that I have tons of experience on the subject. It does make me aware that there are malts out there that are high quality, not from big name distillers and can be had at ‘reasonable’ prices. This is a beautiful malt though.

He comes so damn ""old-school"" therefore (in a consistently positive meaning). This piglet can only be compared with the Glenfarclas 40 OB for me. He smells damn intense and complex without even a tiny ""false note"" show. The alcohol is virtually unnoticeable. But that he should only have 43% but you do not believe in the flavor intensity. A malt that gave me 2.5 hours Malt-Urlaub. A wonderful malt!\nNose\nIncredibly old and noble my first thoughts are with the scent of Glenfarclas 1961. A great combination of intense fruit notes and spicy wood. An intense, fruit-sour cherry with menthol and sweet mint, scalded currant, liquorice, jasmine blossom tea with juice orange, a hint of vanilla pulp, sherry-drenched old wood and lovage are my first associations.\n\nIn the course you can identify spicy balsamic, tobacco and leather couch aromas as well as heavily roasted nuts, sawdust or wood dust of an old sherry moist oak and nutmeg. In the background I mean something like a spicy burnt wood note. Fits in any case wonderful in the flavor portfolio.\n\nYet - nothing seems unbalanced dominant at any given time - a perfect combination of complexity and balance and elegance. For me, this is really big cinema!\nTaste\nThe complexity of the nose continues on the palate:\n\nA dry vinous fruit, intense sweetish orange including orange peel meet long-drawn jasmine tea. Furthermore, you can hear cherry, mint and again mild balsamic. All this with an ""old-school"" draft, which must be surpassed in its intensity first:\n\nMasses of nutmeg, roasted nuts, leather couch associations, mint, dusty old, sherry-rotten oak, laktriz and dark chocolate. Although such an intense spicy oak can be heard, the malt is incredibly balanced and complex.\n\nIt is still hard to believe that the drop has only 43%, as productive as it comes!\nFinish\nThe drop remains eternally felt on the tongue. Comfortably cooling and astringent. Interestingly, I find no coffee flavors. Oranges / orange peel, roasted aromas, walnut, leather, tobacco associations, a clear residual fruit of a consumed cherry and vegetable, tart oak flavors can be heard on the back of the tongue.\n\nOverall, the finish looks like a slightly weakened variant of the initial taste.

Black cherries, dried fruits, plum jam, raisins and dark chocolate are immediately present. In the course of nosing and with sufficient time (well over 30 minutes), more aromas crystallize out. Coffee, tobacco, hints of leather and roasted almonds, overripe oranges, nutmeg and great oak notes (nice spicy) mix with the heavy sherry notes. The alcohol (46%) is perfectly integrated. The nose is very intense, harmonious and multi-faceted. For many sherry lovers, this may be an absolute dream, and for me, next to the 1962 Macallan 80 ° Proof, probably the best sherry nose I've ever had in my glass.\nTaste\nThe mouthfeel of the Macallan is pleasantly creamy and soft, wonderfully full-bodied and after many seconds slightly drier. A pleasant tingling (freshly ground pepper / ginger) sets in on the tip of the tongue. Sweet, juicy cherries, blackberries, lots of plums and raisins, cocoa butter, dark chocolate and tobacco are dominant. Juicy grapefruit leave a minimal sour-fruity sting. Slightly bitter orange marmalade, leather, nutmeg, a touch of caramel and noticeably spicy oak notes complete the heavy aroma festival. The Macallan is wonderfully balanced, harmonious, very elegant and has a tremendous amount of depth. A small sip of espresso and light walnut notes pave the way towards the finish. Wonderful.\nFinish\nVery long, very sherrylastig, spicy and warm. Black cherries, dried fruits, plums, raisins and plenty of dark chocolate mingle with nutmeg, leather, tobacco and spicy, old wood tones.

How can one not have expectations?\n\nN: Objectivity, go! Wow, that is awesome though, an old Old & Rare style nose with oodles of freshness and strength. It reminds me of a number of [G&M] 45-50yo bottlings [Glen Grant, Strathisla etc,..] that I’ve tried and been disappointed by their fragility and impactfulness at 40% abv [and dropping]. A bottling like this, presented at cask strength, gives us the best of it all. Being creamy, phenolic and slightly mucky yet beautifully composed, those Spanish sherry butts help support that O&R air, with a certain nudge towards TTR [tamari, tomato and rancio]. Without doubt one of the most amazing contemporary old skool noses I’ve ever smelt, not quite in tOMoH’s 1955 Bowmore league [WLP96] just yet, but give it a few more decades. It’s delectable now with only 13 or so years in glass.\n\nT: The nose translates well on the palate, the sherry casks present yet respectful and positively influential. Unlike the 18yo, this needs a little water [in the mouth only], to help clear away any prickly palate shocks and allowing the flavour compounds to work their magic. Add a little water for a luscious yet slightly dry and somewhat heavy sweet < bitter peatiness to slowly emerge and expand. Reminding me more of a heavier dirtier Ledaig, this hasn’t the finesse of the 18yo, yet held in the mouth, the taste-combos are a real treat.\n\nF: Slightly drying oaky dried-fruity chocolate on the turn, eventually into light creamy milky chocolatey [again] barley – all slightly salty – and with any number of older whiskies & other spirit references from various eras that may ensue. Oaky O&R-sherried salty earthy-peaty coke combos ring and ring with a herbal Vermouth note at the death. There’s a slight lighter fluid note somewhere along the tail not to mention Milk of Magnesia and rose water, but these are fleeting top notes.\n\nC: With 6642 bottles released, is there a fair chance of finding one for a fair price one day? For the nose alone, I wonder how much I’d be prepared to pay for such an aromatic treasure? I find it less sublime on the palate but I’m nit-picking at this high level. Cracking whisky!', 'Whiskyfun: The 16yo has long been to Lagavulin what the 911 was to Porsche but we’re more than happy to see more variants coming out, especially since those are more Turbos than Boxters in our opinion... Okay, enough crappy analogies, let’s try this brand new 21yo, due for later this autumn (we already had a taste of a pre-vatting at the Islay Festival). It’s an important bottling, as it comes from Spanish sherry European oak casks only – not American oak like often with sherry. Besides, we’ve been told that there won’t be any other ‘full sherry’ versions in the future. Colour: full amber. Nose: what is striking are the obvious common roots between the old 12yo and this new 21yo. This one is more ‘direct’ at first nosing, though. Sweeter, creamier, immediately on peat plus sherry plus the assembling of both (if you see what I mean)... Simple? Indeed, but just for a few seconds, as it then starts to shoot aromatic arrows one after the other. Menthol, hazelnut oil, oxtail, prunes, orange marmalade, smoked ham, curry, mustard (hints), walnut liqueur. Slight hints of phosphorus (although not like a ‘simple’ bunch of matchsticks). And it goes on, getting wilder now... Game (just like in the old 12yo), eucalyptus (I know brands are not cool but I’d dare to say ‘Vicks’)... And then strawberry jam, sea water... Please take your time when you’ll try this one, the development is ‘very gradual’ but it’s really worth it. A fireworks show. Mouth: here’s the punch that the 12yo was lacking, but also a slight ‘brutality’ at the attack. A true peaty grip in fact and an extreme ‘ampleur’. Quite some pepper, walnuts, crystallised ginger, strong liquorice, tar, mint and eucalyptus sweets again (very bold!), bitter oranges... And a powerful smokiness. The saltiness grows bolder as well... No sulphur that I can get... Wood ashes, herb liqueurs (green Chartreuse – are you listening, O.?), Havana tobacco (like when you chew your cigar). Also hints of ripe gooseberries and dried longans. And sticky toffee pudding, of course. Finish: very long, concentrated, ample, salty and liquoricy – amusing how this one makes you thirsty. We also tried it with water, it got more on mint and eucalyptus (and oranges) but other than that the general profile stayed the same. Who said this was an important bottling? 95 points. http://www.whiskyfun.com/archiveseptember07-1.html#040907', 'Compared with the last time I drank this wine, it was still black pepper steak-style peat that made people drunk, but it lacked the power of three points into the wood, and added some unclear fruits.\nNose\nTurkish cuisine with ginseng sherry, black pepper tomato oxtail soup, yellow mustard, saffron, sage, herbs, lemon juice with smoked salmon, heavy oil billowing with thick smoke billowing to charcoal roasting Block fat, a good bacon dish.

Leather,\ncocoa, menthol (Vick's vapo-rub), ginger, lingonberries (tart 'red'),\nand camphor. Pinch of high quality salt with honey and ham. (with water)\nFar more mossy and sea-weed. The fruit and toffee notes fade. Still\ngolden.\n\nPalate: Thick liqueur on the palate. Immediately on\nhoney, ginger, salt, leather, and caramel with some coffee and sticky\npudding. The peat comes out, inevitably, like flames from smouldering\nembers. Really about the same as the nose, perhaps more gentle than I'd\nhave expected, but no wall-flower this. Fabulous. (with water) Swims\nwell. Peat is more prominent, and the thick, chewiness dissipates. More\nashy, but the honeyed and salty notes still persist in the background.\n\nFinish:\nWhat's left to say? The notes probably will remind people of the 16 or\nDistillers Edition, and for good cause. That's all in here, though the\nage and sherry maturation gives it much more heft, depth, and richness.\nThe quality is top notch. Water, for me, undid some of what made it\nspecial, but it's a clear winner.

A solid sherry but absolutely not greedy, rather of the dry kind as a stroke of cudgel, and that brings notes of rubber (diving snorkel) which stick completely to the profile.

Very good but not greatness.', ""Tasting note by Serge Valentin\n\nMacallan 1963/1980 'Special Selection' (43%, OB, Rinaldi) Five stars There used to be an official 1963 in a crystal decanter that was very good (WF 89) but not stunning. This may be greater… Colour: amber. Nose: how did they do that? Unmistakably old sherried Macallan, with this wonderful balance that’s rarely to be found in any other malt (including modern Macallans). Many fruit liqueurs, many dried fruits and many herbs, all that being wonderfully ‘interwoven’ and hence more ‘compact’ than others. Wild strawberries, figs, orange blossom water, rosewater, white chocolate, hawthorn tea and this very peculiar smokiness that was only to be found in these old Macs. Also polished wood (precious wood, sandal, thuja…) And parsley and lovage… Better stop now because it would just go on and on.\n\nMouth: big and rich, maybe less entrancing than on the nose because of the slight dryness (grape pips, walnut skin) but still quite beautiful. Orange marmalade, dates, raspberry eau-de-vie and old fortified wine (Banyuls). I guess that’s the sherry talking… Touches of lemon. Finish: medium long, with a little more smoke and liquorice. Some mint and cough syrup in the aftertaste. Comments: it’s maybe not as flabbergastingly complex as some other vintages at Macallan (1930s, 1940s, 1950s and some from the 1960s) but it’s still fabulous whisky. This smokiness isn’t to be found in any modern Macallans. SGP:653 - 91 points."", 'Never having had old Macallans like this before, I was rather skeptical. “How good can these paxarette-infused malts of yester year be?”. I’m so glad I joined\ninto this bottle split and a thousand thanks for the kind soul, who split it at an amazing price. My advice, for a lover of sherried malts can only be to go\nout and look for a sample of either this, or some of the other vintage Macallans out there. It will put your impressions of contemporary bottling in perspective. This would have scratched my personal 95 point legendary rank, but the finish warrants a small deduction.\nNose\nA slow walk in a tranquil forest. I can only describe the initial nose as ‘elegant’. Delicate Oloroso, all kinds of dried grapes and plums, and (as it was rather customary back then) hints of peat smoke. With some air – sandal wood, faint incense, and pleasant sweetness. The smoke is gone again, but now there is old Armagnac [had a 1967 Vintage de Montal before, and there is certainly some convergence].\nAssociations of gravy for roasted poultry, lashes of perfumed oak, and cinnamon-sprinkled sugar syrup. Don’t make it stop!\nTaste\nWow. While the nose was rather austere, akin to (very) well-composed modern sherry malts, once this hits your palate you can taste the difference. Initially a\nburst of black forrest fruit – something I’ve only encountered in a 1976 Benrinnes so far. Then… freshness – like morning dew on a star fruit or mango.\nIs this OBE? Macallan’s spirit? Or simply the paxarette? Not sweet, not sour, not bitter, not sharp. Neutral juicy pleasantness. After 4 or 5 seconds, the alcohol finally says hello. Tannins, stewed plums, and raspberry jam.\nFinish\nMedium. Naturally, the only (minor) downside. At this strength, the punch is just not on par with modern UCF-46% malts.

Just my two cents!', 'First: I always have my difficulties with these old malts and fluctuate between awe and try neutral evaluation. It is precisely this objective assessment that makes me think. Do I then subconsciously rate myself worse, as I do not want to be blinded by awe, or do I actually judge better because of the story this malt has lived through? I dont know.\nHowever, as I tend to rate such \'old malts\' a lot worse than the average, I suspect that I\'m just not the type for that particular kind of taste (which they all have in common). Attention: Wailing at a damn high level ????\n\nAroma / Nose feeling:\nA potpourri of different flavors - what diversity! In front of such a glass I can sit for hours and smell it. Deep, full, heavy and dignified. Quiet, sweet with a hint of anise. Plum compote with rum, coconut milk, almonds, cereals, wax, ripe pear, berry haribo, loam soil and cotton candy. A constant change of flavors makes this malt an absolute dream of aromas.\nContinue with some vegetables, dates, dark chocolate with marzipan and tents.\nThe nose is underlined by a leathery, dusty, slightly musty clay, which I perceive as very suitable and age appropriate.\n\nTaste / mouthfeel:\nWith light tingling, leather, bitter first impression and a little sourdough, the old Scotch greets me on the tongue. Uff - what happens here? The bunnahabhain suddenly changes its structure in the mouth. As if the sip of whisky would change in my mouth. I\'ve never been this way and confused myself. I honestly can not describe it either. You have to experience it yourself.\nVanilla, hops, malt and a creaminess, which unfortunately gets watery with time, are to be found. Also floral notes, dark bitter chocolate and hot berries on vanilla sauce.\nHowever, what I do not like here (and also in the finish) is the already mentioned in the introduction sucked impression that leaves the malt in the mouth. This impression is reinforced after sipping on the glass to the finish. This old, ailing, ""stale-mineral-water-carbonic-moderate"" - I do not like it (unfortunately). A shallow comparison - I know - but I think I can explain the best so what I mean: Coke without carbonation. Brrrrrrr !!\n\nFinish / aftertaste / Length:\nA sweet, short- to medium-long finish with slightly mineral and floral notes, which gets a little bitter over time and brings the oak to light. Clove, cold coffee with cream and some geranium accompany the overall impression.\n\nOverall impression / comment:\nYes, what should I say. For me, such old malts are like people who are full of life years. They have a great deal to tell and have had to experience and suffer a lot in their long lives. Nevertheless - the power of the youth (of course with all the disadvantages) has disappeared and usually those people are missing at the end of life but a bit of élan.\nExactly this Elan I miss in general with old malts. In the end, they are too bland, too exhausted. Of course, this Bunna is very memorable (especially the nose) but for me this malt would not be for every day. In the taste and the departure of the old warhorse loses me too many sympathy points and acts on me as if he was abandoned by all life spirits.\nAs mentioned in the beginning, all this complaining is of a high standard and I also understand what is desirable about such an old malt, but honestly?

The interplay of the soft oak flavors with the complex fruitiness and mouth-watering spice really testifies to an exceptional malt. Not only the key data shows that you have something special in the glass. Of course you can not rate this Bunnahabhain biased and at a blindsample my euphoria would probably have been a bit lower, but I had just one of my most special and most intense whisky experiences. I'm excited!\nNose\nWow! This is how 50 years smell. What flows towards me here is so complex and new to me that I need some time to sort out my impressions. I already know that my description can only reasonably do justice to the malt, since a list of all the associations that hit my head would span the frame. I still try my best. The first flavor package I would describe as a combination of old leather, old lacquered wood (like the cabin of an old sailing boat) and a very interesting fruitiness. This reminds me most of dried apple rings, candied rhubarb and very aromatic raisins. However, the description of this fruitiness is extraordinarily difficult for me, as it is very complex and always shows new nuances. With a little time, a wonderfully in-spice of cloves and star anise and a mouth-watering creaminess join the other flavors. On the one hand, the creaminess reminds me of fragrant vanilla pastry, on the other hand, of cigar leaves or the creamy-fruity aromas of a noble champagne. I could hold my nose in the glass for hours and I would not run out of associations.\nTaste\nThe taste reflects wonderfully the impressions from the Nosing again. Again, there is a very complex and incredibly round interaction of old leather, tobacco, old wood and carnations and star anise. But notes of cinnamon, cantuccini and cocoa with a dash of amaretto characterize the taste.\nFinish\nEspecially the Cantuccini pastry and the cocoa with amaretto determined the finish immediately after swallowing. These aromas reconnect with the notes of cloves and cinnamon, as well as a distinct fruitiness of raisins, dates and dried apricots. Especially the fruit flavors remain in the mouth for a long time.

And what should go wrong with a 1973 Longmorn?  I bought this sample at the Limburg Whisky Fair.\n\nThe colour is very dark at brown sherry and the texture shows a sticky ring with medium-size tears and slow legs.  The nose offers an impressively rich old-school sherry profile that is both barley sugary-sweet, sherry-fruity and spicy-woody (in a delicious way).  So the malt could keep up with the heavy sherry wood-induced flavours and all created a balanced profile, exactly the way I like it!  The mouthfeel of this dram is thick and almost syrupy - it coats the whole of the mouth in a second with a wonderful warm feeling and just minor bitter moments from the heavier tannins.  The taste is bold and complex on all the fine old-style sherry flavours we all adore (or don\'t you?) in a firm wooden setting,  But again the barley sugars are not shy and hold their head up thus creating a harmony of flavours that is hard to match.  The finish is very long and extends this beautiful taste for minutes with a minor drying-astringent ending (tannins again).  Some water turns both the nose and taste more punchy while more water takes this out again.  Now even more aromas and flavours pop up but the dram looses some of its astonishing powerful profile this way.  So water is recommended only if you own more than just a small sample.\n\nAnother benchmark Kingsbury bottling with an old-school sherry maturation close to perfection - no, this is perfection, actually.  Too bad it cannot re-created anymore (because of the Paxarette ban of the SWA from 1989) so we have to enjoy these old jewels as long as they are still available (for a hell of bucks, unfortunately).

Luckily, there is a special occasion today and I look forward to this tasting experience. \n\nThis PX sherry cask yielded just 84 bottles after 37 years of maturation and there are two possible causes for such a very low yield:  Either the cask was leaking for some time and the angels took more than their fair share or (more probably) this whisky matured that extraordinary well that the managers and warehouse staff had to check its quality more often than usual...  What would you do if you were in their shoes and you know where the best cask is stored in the warehouse?  That is why the best matured casks often yield much less bottles compared to other (average) casks of the same vintage and age.  So I hope for the latter!\n\nYes, I am pretty sure now.  The angels just took their usual share from this cask and the rest fell prey to regular quality checks of the staff (and visitors).  A great dram, indeed and a very worthy selection for today's special occasion...\nNose\n94\n94\nThe colour is brown sherry and the texture shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass and very slow moving legs. The nose offers a bold and flawless sherry profile with creamy toffee and honey aromas. Lots of different spices, herbs and shy fruits join in and sort themselves into a firm wooden framework. All greatly balanced and complex.\nTaste\n95\n95\nThe taste is very creamy and charming and multi-layered, of course. All these adorable sherry-induced flavours march side by side with the great aromas of long matured sixties Springbank malt as if they celebrate a victory parade. Most notably are the honey and toffee malty notes within a fruity sherry stew (raisins, plums, orange peels and many more) that is all stirred in a spicy wooden bowl. Simply delicious and adorable, I could chew this for minutes. Some water releases even more aromas (e.g., lots of different chocolates) both in the nose and on the palate and it smoothes the dram - turning it even more quaffable. Surprisingly even the diluted dram shows no bitterness or astringent moments what usually happens when adding water to heavily sherried whiskies. I like both the power of the neat dram at 56.5% and the dangerously quaffable reduced version at about 46% abv.\nFinish\n95\n95\nThe dram arrives warming on the palate and instantly coats the whole of the mouth without any distracting feeling besides some minor peppery moments (that are rather enjoyable in this mix). An unusual excellent mouthfeel for such a long sherry maturation as there are neither bitter nor astringent moments at all - this was bottled exactly at the right time. The finish is (as expected from the oiliness) very long and vanishes slowly in different waves. Not a single drying or bitter moment here, again. It offers more spices that nicely pep up the whole dram towards the end, just like a farewell greeting.""]",WB11864,Single Malt,Springbank,2006,37 years old,Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood,56.5 % Vol.,700 ml,8,"['lincolnimp', 'lincolnimp', 'Baanaanaabob', 'dram-drinker', 'ctu', 'Hvdree', 'ARDBERG', 'hs305']","['95', '95', '93', '96', '93', '93', '95', '95']"

Majestic. With water: the animal and farm look becomes even more present, with hints of Frankfurter sausage with mustard, a real hot dog! The fruits are then relegated to the background without disappearing. A festival of spices is also appearing: sweet pepper, curry, garam masala.\nTaste\nThe texture is fat and sticks to the palate. The flavors are inextricably linked, perfectly fused into each other. We find the exotic fruits, but caught in a smoked and peppered gangue, bardées of smoked and salted breast. A stunning and sumptuous mix. With water: the woods and spices are felt, as well as a slight bitterness.

Wait a while and don't stick your nose in it, that's where the fire starts and jitters up the nose. Hot green Sichuan peppercorn, lapsang souchong tea, salted paprika, blood orange, lime peel, cumin seeds.\nTaste\n93\n93\nMelted cream cheese, creme brulee, nutmeg cake, hazelnut chocolate of 40 - 60 % darkness. Water brings out orange, ripen, and heavy citrus. It's a bomb of fruit notes - orange again, pear, cantaloupe, candied ginger, onion cooked in butter and drizzled with seawater.\n\nMalted sweetness prevails, where chocolate, sweet caramel, reduced brown sugar, toasted pecans, chocolate chip cookies, and all thing sweet, thick, and dense; Like molasses or treacle but with the added complexity. Sherry does not show up like other sherried whiskies but rather creeps up in the form of more complex notes.\n\nRich earth notes are evident too, mostly towards the back hitting on the finish. It's like drinking sparkling water from a heavily mineralized water source, both dry and gritty.\nFinish\n92\n92\nSpicy of course, warm peat, sweet chocolate, licorice, black bread, cardamom seeds, ash, dried persimmons, roasted lamb chops with rosemary. Sulfur is good here, could do more but it might kill off the sweet lighter notes."", 'Candied fruits, toffee, iodine, stewed plums, orange, great sherry and peat integration but the slight leather notes prevent me from rating it higher.', 'Quite a large rubbery note, both on the nose and palate for me.

It's still rich outside of Shirley, minerals, earth, spices, toasted oak bars, chocolate syrup. The expressiveness is a bit lost (but it may be a problem with the body condition), the balance is perfect, and the aromas come and go. I added three drops of water to 15ml of wine, which released more fruit, orange, plum, and anger. It's a pity that I can't find too many Taliskers.\n\nDrink: The taste is very special, it is sticky and oily, and then the taste molecules spread out in the mouth. The aroma of sauce, chocolate, fresh sherry, the end rhyme is very long, cherries, sour strawberries, mulberries, puree, and continue to make you salivate.\n\nOverall: The smell of this berry fruit reminds me of Longmorn in 1965, but it is more complex, more exciting, and more showy. After drinking 60's Clynelish and 50's Highlang park, I still want to say that, this special taste can be described as amazing. It's like acting in your mouth.

So I selected this one and I think the chance of being disappointed here is close to zero.  I bought bottle no. 3995 for 107 Euro in November, 2002 (hence the price score).\n\nThe colour is russetmuscat and the texture shows a great oiliness of many small tears that stick to the top of the glass and consolidate to a fat sticky ring that does not move at all.  Very late some bigger tears appear that do not build legs.  This promises an excellent mouthfeel and very long finish!  The nose is quite impressive on a fine spicy-herbal sherry profile with dozens of different aromas in a firm, appropriate wooden setting.  Despite the 62% abv it is not punchy at all.  The dram arrives hot on the palate (remember: 62% abv) and it immediately covers the whole of the mouth with a warming feeling, simply excellent.  One of the best mouthfeels I had for a long time and not a single minor distracting moment (like bitter, drying or adstringent notes).  The taste is multi-layered around this superb sherry profile with all the sherry-induced flavours one can dream of.  It is supplemented by a delicious spicy wooden framework and a couple of sweet barley sugars (different ones, I swear!).  Again not a single flaw that I can find.  The finish is very long and spicier than the taste with some minor bitter notes (tannins) at the very end that are rather welcomed (as a counterpart to the sweet sherry flavours) than distracting.  Some water releases even more aromas in the nose and it turns the taste and finish sweeter.  But be careful not to add too much water as the dram flattens quickly below around 48% abv.  Actually I like it best when reduced to about 50% abv.\n\nAs expected, the chance of being disappointed by this dram is not close to but it is zero!

All 5 Brora OB in Glencairns the Clynelish in a Tulip.\nThe Clynelish is here because for me its  Brora, distilled in the Brora Stills about 1960 and I will put the tasting notes for this in the Brora section, also for some reason never bothered doing a tasting note for the 2003 before.\n\nNose\n05 – 1st  similar to Clynelish\n73 -  2nd Clynelish –\n04 – 3rd\n06 – 4th\n02 – 5th\n03 -  6th\n\nFirst nosing\n02 better than 03, 04 more powerful and peaty, 05 similar to 04 but less peat and more elegant, -06 similar to 05, clynelish 73 more waxy and fruity.\n\n2nd nosing\n04, 05, 06 very similar now, \n02 & 03 similar, less expressive more fruity than peaty, clynelish more fruity\n\nPalate\n02 – creamy & peaty\n03 – Fruity & peaty\n04 -  Very sweet, beautifully balanced and the peat is there\n05 – weaker compared to the 04 at first but this one is very subtle more creamy but less expressive on the palate than the 04.\n06 – Siimilar to the 05 but peat is louder in this one\nClynelish, waxy, peaty & fruity\n\n04, - 1st\n05, - 2nd\n06, -3rd\n02 -  4th\n03 – 5th          \n\nThe clynelish I could not decide but probably in the middle of these 5 on rating but the profile is obviously different.\n\nThere really is not much to chose from all are great but palate wise the 2004 30 year Brora is the best because until then I would have said the 2005 was my favourite 30 year Brora OB but that why they need comparing together.', '[March, 2017] After the Russians (Krim), the English (Brexit), the Americans (Trump) now the Turks went crazy - only the Dutch stayed calm and I like the Dutch for that AND because they are great (quality) whisky drinkers. That is why I decided to call this a Brora day - I need something really, really good now.\n\nAnd I will do two head-to-heads: the 30-years old 5th vs. the 25-years old 7th release and the two 20-years old Rare Malts from 1975 and 1982 against each other.\n\nSo the clear winner is the 5th release mainly for its bigger complexity (yes, peat induces a lot of additional flavours and aromas over such a long time) without any sign of getting tired. Nevertheless the 7th profile is very nice too, but in a blind tasting you would not guess these two drams are from the same distillery and of a comparable age. Really interesting to see the difference peat makes...\nNose\n93\n93\nThe 5th is remarkably darker than the 7th, much more as the 5 additional years of maturation could explain. So most probably more refill casks on the 7th side. The nose of the 5th is much more powerful and complex with lots of flavours that remind me of the Scottish countryside (the smell of cow stables, wet haystacks and wet sheperd dogs). And a quite dominant eucalyptus note besides dozens of other aromas. Contrary to this the 7th is much more simple mainly on a vanilla and almond profile rounded up with some exotic fruits. Clear winner is the 5th, but the 7th is on a high level too.\nTaste\n92\n92\nAgain the 5th is much more complex with dozens of different flavours and aromas based on peat, marzipan, herbs and spices (vanilla is just marginal here). The 7th is based all around vanilla and fruity flavours (again almost no peat). Very different, but the 5th wins again.\nFinish\n93\n93\nBoth have a fat, oily and coating arrival on the palate with heavy peat notes on the 5th and almost no peat at all on the 7th side, but a very nice sweetness there. Both are quite punchy, I like that. Both own a very long finish with advantages on the 5th side again due to the greater complexity. No drying or unpleasant woody notes in both.', 'The smell and flavour are so versatile, refined, robust, full-bodied and abundant that the ride almost exceeds the pain-threshold. Might drive one over the edge of so-called ""normalcy"" with the deep existential dilemma it poises: what is one to do when everything you\'ve ever sensed before turns out to be a cheap-copy supermarket version of what the reality can be?\nNose\nSalty and waxy at first. With water and some time: engine oil, citrusy fruitiness: orange, lime, tangerine, lemon. A bit of smoked meat, gooseberry, blackcurrant, lapsang seuchang, a waft of soap (Savon de Marseille, of course). Than it turns to sweet and dusty summery hay notes, apricot dry & fresh, a deep fragnant sweetness of the kind of charas -hash, an appel-y, savoury sea-breeze that fills the nose, tar and old rope on a shipdeck. An astounding variety of nuances and components, yet coherent in a very rich manner.\nTaste\nQuite a peat-blast, though actually quite sweet. Mouthfilling and delicate:boletus-mushrooms, maple syrup, really good round, soft and candied smoke, brown sugar, hazelnut, chestnut, liquorice, the good old Nestea lemontee powder of childhood, fresh mint, hints of star-anise.\nFinish\nA bit of milk-chocolate, savoury liquorice and salmiak. It goes on and on - probably the longest farewell I\'ve experienced.', ""It is very very good and very very drinkable. Hard to be disappointed.\nNose\nThe nose is incredibly clear and expressive. The aromas are very chiseled. Peel mixes one has pineapple, passion fruit, but especially rosemary, anise, hay, dry grass. An earthy side with a light peat. We smell a bit of heather honey that brings a little roundness.\nTaste\nThe alcohol is remarkably balanced and it's an explosion of flavor. We have a good part of the aromas of the nose present. Anise, fruity. The peat is less spring and a fruit jam take over.\nFinish\nPeat, a mentholated and aniseed tip, and ... apple."", ""What a whisky: a greatest hits collection of the best whisky aromas. This is what dreams are made of. I compared this several times head to head with 3rd release (2004) and could not pick a winner so I scored them the same, giving one less point to 2003 and 2013.\nNose\nThis is magic already neat. The nose is very rich and expressive yet most refined - talking 'old Glenfarclas'-refined. A little damp, and musty like wet worn leather, and then on the other hand I find some notes that remind me of old whisky casked in a not-so-active sherry butt, and then something oily (greased boot?). Water makes it a bit cake-y, like the base of a Runeberg torte (a cognac-infused small cake with a jam topping) that's been sitting on the table for a while. The smoke is not that Islay bonfire smoke at all, but rather like an oil burner. Some porridge-like note comes up every now and then, and I'd swear I caught the smell I get from an opened hard boiled egg. Hay and some gamey animal-like smells (musty, not like fresh beef but rather like a living thing). Lamp oil, paint thinner, and white bread. Dirty without being negatively so.\nTaste\nJust a little drop neat: heavy stuff, heavy like Islay but in a different way. Very rich and unusually oily in a positive way. Fatty rather than vegetable oil-like. With water: At teaspoon or two still a bit too hot but tastewise this is nuking all my senses. I love the smoothly delivered yet heavy peatiness in it so very much. With more water I get a bit of plaster and a lot of soot. The body seems to be able to take plenty of water without losing consistency. Saltiness, tarriness, fresh liquorice, with something metallic in the back.\nFinish\nMedium dry finish that sinks into the lips and the tongue and lasts longer than your average symphony.

The 'dirty' notes are divided between damp wood, hay, cellar; but then, we said, a small enchanted world: there is certainly an overall but discrete blanket of minerality and peat (with a compound smoking but very present: cenere di braci, own). But to stun is a whole 'sweet' side with striking complexity: from an intense orange (both dry and peel) to chocolate packs, from mandarin to red apples to great creamy suggestions (creaminess and sweetness: panettone, powdered sugar, tarte tatin, marzipan raisins, who more ...). So good smell of wood, spicy. Even a note of bacon. P: the pattern is similar to the nose: the start is on dirty notes (say stall / wax), with the mineral side and a more smoky vegetable peat that are enhanced compared to the nose. Then comes the load of sweet and fruity sweetness (we add a clear note of honey flowers), which seems there to explode in a nuclear triumph: but surprisingly this dram turns out to be 'Broresco Brora' more: they come back in fact tense notes intense and insistent oily wax and peat and smoked, with some slight marine note. Then however still important is citrus. Spicy tips: ginger? Fantastique. Over time it is even more round, the sweetness opens up in a ghastly triumph. Top, really. F: would you ever imagine that this ending may not be enchanting? You could, of course: but you would be wrong, and big. Super ash, even a little salty. Infinity.

So, this one was distilled shortly after they had rebuilt, extended, and restarted the distillery. Colour: light white wine. Nose: naturally, the #1 question is 'what's the difference' between this and the newer ones. The answer is that this would be both more mineral and grassier, and less 'brutally smoky and coastal'. Besides, you wouldn't quite know about what's only the consequence of bottle ageing. What's obvious is that this nose is more complex, with more lamp oils, polishes, fresh almonds and pine nuts, ink, gums, linseed oil, other oils, also anything camphory and ointmenty (I apologise), while we'd even find notes of beef grease and mutton suet. Yeah, Belgian French fries. With water: we're on pine saps and resin and retsina and stuff. Raw Islay lambswool. Mouth (neat): amazingly ueber-peated, with a spectacular and unexpected herbal side. Loud verbena and old green chartreuse. Bang. With water: there, the coastal side, sardines and anchovies, oysters, samphires, spirulina, then lemons and limes. Then metal polish, ink, wee hints of Brussels sprouts perhaps… Finish: very long, more on green citrus. Lime and green grapefruit. Cough syrup in the aftertaste. Comments: exceptional young whisky.

Great stuff from the past, no doubt.\nNose\n96\n96\nThe colour is burnished and the nose offers an excellent old-style sherry maturation without any flaw. This is complexity and harmony at its best, both all the fine 'farclas malt's and fino sherry's aromas are present and all combine to an impressive nose I could sniff for hours. There some tasty OBF's too, oh - how I adore these! The wood is perfect and neither too strong nor too weak. After some breathing this nose grows even more spectacular so take your time with this dram. And use a big spherical blender's glass for nosing, if available.\nTaste\n94\n94\nThe taste is multi-layered on dozens of different flavours in a superb mix. They can be perfectly explored while chewing the dram for some time, and they march across my taste buds in a victory parade. All starts with fruits and honeys but the bitter-spicy flavours join in quickly and ensure the balance of the profile. Again I do not find any flaw, all is close to perfection. Even the wood is okay for such a long maturation (strong but not over-powering).\nFinish\n91\n91\nThe initial mouthfeel is warming and coating (but not I expected more in this respect, to be honest) without distracting moments. The finish is medium to long and adds more spicy wooden notes without turning bitter or astringent until the very end.

After 30 minutes it opens a little, some hand warmth helps to unfreeze it and gradually release more and more of its aroma fireworks. What a perfect barrel, the fino influences go hand in hand as harmoniously as a perfect mirror image. I wouldn't guess 47 years, but the tendency would be 40 if I were to taste it blind. Over time, it becomes more oaky, and the very minimal sour fruitiness recedes into the background.\nTaste\n94\n94\nBoom, 50% and the alcohol is only there to drive the aromas in your mouth and is as smooth and creamy as you would like it to be.

Great but a tad disappointing because of the relative narrowness of the first nose. But then… there’s an avalanche of smaller, more complex, more tertiary aromas.

Perfect. Mouth: exceptional arrival, spicy and zesty at the same time. Again, marmalade with a little white pepper. And then, chartreuse jaune, orange liqueur, a funny herbal zestiness (angelica? Kiwi jam?) as well as walnuts again, but less than in the nose. I find the sherry rather discrete. Finish: very long and always spicy/zesty. The oak feels a little more than in the Glenlivet, but the spirit’s structure is fatter so balance is kept. Marmalade with pepper and wasabi or horseradish. Comments: I find this absolutely superb.

We love the notes of wax, the trademark of this distillery and the \'twin\' Clynelish: the wax is accompanied by those stale notes of damp and dusty wood (cellar, if not its own stable), to then dance with oily and mineral tips. The \'sweetness\' (which however, mind you, certainly is not in the background and is perfectly integrated) moves between vanilla, ripe apples, but also raisins, orange jam ... The nuances in this area are almost endless (red fruits , dates, figs). All embellished with a vast bouquet of spices: cloves, aniseed, nutmeg ... With a few drops of water, only the experience of the wood fragrance deserves the ticket price: compared to before, it tends to slightly fade the side mineral and oily, but everything else is enhanced, with a riot of orange a bit \'gone. P: what a body, how elegant: greeted by a blanket of smoke, we find ourselves wandering between licorice, dried fruit, still raisins, and again that wood that in one\'s mouth is one with spices. But with every sip change, layers and tinsel are added: wax comes back, coconut (and vanilla) arrives, sweet and delicate red fruits dance ... A lot of honey, lots of citrus peel, especially with water. F: very long, we did not believe that the scents of burnt wood remained so long, however flanked by a lot of dried fruit and a pleasant composite sweetness (ripe fruit). Sensation almost unpublished: sweet smoke. We hope to be able to taste other releases of this distillery (remember that since 2001 every year comes out a bottling in the special releases of Diageo), but they are very rare and very expensive. The profile is unique: those stale notes (say ""stable"", so to speak may seem unpleasant, but integrate perfectly in a great complexity and are really fantastic) are just unique, and only in some old Talisker we happened to find them. Compared to the younger Brora we had drunk some time ago, however, these notes are slightly attenuated, in favor of greater smoking and an overall, clearer roundness.

The element of citrus peel in the taste is obvious. Under normal circumstances, it will be a point of deduction. However, under the support of the previous syrup, I think it is more suitable to imagine him as a decorative and flavorful lemon peel. Considering this, the overall It becomes balanced and complementary. This wine is nothing more than a bottle of condensed malt. The strong and full flavor is not the point. The key is the precise balance of the taste. This Caol Ila has told us for 15 years: the wine with simple flavor can also be excellent.\nNose\n88\n88\nSmell: The concentration of the aroma is low if the oiliness is excluded. Sea water, brackish pork, grease, cold asparagus, yes, you can still experience similar flavors in modern Genting. After I wake up, there is fresh red apple flesh on the rim of the cup, a little dust, grass, motor oil, and a little lemon peel. In the case of extremely weak peat, the irritation and blankness of the aroma are slightly stronger.\nTaste\n95\n95\nTaste: The smoky sensation is always online, but it is very light before the end. There is a little sea salt when touched, the ham is fresh, the condensed lemon sour mint syrup, but the sweetness is very restrained and balanced, and the cheeks are a little bit The sense of sesame pepper is light and balanced by the sense of peat, and then together with the light smoky sense is barley sugar mixed with a little mint syrup and fresh lemon zest. The overall style is biased towards the style of Bourbon barrels. The middle section is amazing, and the performance of the latter section is infinitely similar to the barley sugar flavor of the front section of Caol Ila unpeated. The wine has strong power, strong oiliness, full and comfortable flavor, and extremely weak irritation.

I tried it again at Old and Rare 2020 in London and this was one of my favorites there.

Tarmac, linseed oil, coal smoke, then cough lozenges, something even more medicinal (bandages), paint, soot, green bananas, mushrooms, fresh mint, moss… Frankly, the complexity is simply amazing. With water: more smoke coming out - makes me think of a 1960s Ardbeg. Stunning! Mouth (neat): we're in the same league as with the 1980 by Sig., except that this is even more complex, sappier, smokier, grassier, more herbal, more citrusy… Everything is perfect here, absolutely everything. Stunning grassy profile for lovers of this style. Greatly un-modern. With water: swims like a champ. Flabbergasting smoky/grassy/herbal profile. Finish: long and very tarry and herbal and smoky.

As a result, they thought they had just started, but they were already at their peak. Going back to this wine, there is a feeling of doing nothing but doing nothing. If we say that some wines are predestined for three points, and seven points rely on oak, then this bottle can be turned around three or seven, and the original material can be used without mashbill in Scotland. Is it because of the nitrogen content of barley that year? Saccharification process? Yeast strain? How long is the fermentation time? The outstanding wine body created enables the winery to wholesale fine wines? These questions eventually fell into the stomach with the old wine one by one, undetectable.\nNose\nThere is no need to bother to think about what heavy Shirley, heavy peat, a solid wine body that is not inferior to the size of the same period, and the most authentic malt distilled wine. Plump, finely prepared coarse grains, unthreshed cereals, corns, vanilla honey, pastries and farmhouses. The influence of young fruits, oranges, yellow lemons, pineapples, peaches, and Shirley buckets is not noticeable, bringing a lot of sugar and a sense of beauty.

I originally had a glass of this excellent whisky back when I was only beginning my whisky hobby, and while I recognized it as a good one, I wrote down nothing about it and rated it 90, thinking it was good but not truly special.\n\nNow, years later, I had a chance to try this famous Linlithgow again, and I'm floored: This is just the kind of naked, distillate-heavy, Rare Malts-ish profile I've only come to love through experience and a thorough investigation of all that Scotch whisky has to offer.\n\nThere's a lesson to be learned here: revisit your old scores, especially from the time you were only starting your hobby, and re-examine your premises. It does good for a man, or a woman, to admit that perhaps the nuances of the very best malts only open up to an experienced palate, and a snap judgment made early in your journey isn't worth much. Granted, from my then 90 points to 92 now isn't much of a change, but the years in between at least have made me capable of articulating why I think back then I wasn't seeing this one in the light it truly deserves.\nNose\nA beautiful nose! It's a vaguely fruity, vaguely peaty affair with a fair amount of worn, old, sour oak. Naked and glorious, and if not exactly similar, then not that far away from Rare Malts Linkwood 1972s (later RM Linkwoods aren't from old Linkwood, and don't count). Some herbal salts come up every now and then, and faint white pepper. Water opens it up some, but doesn't change the overall profile much. It doesn't sound like much by descriptors, maybe, but realize that these kind of noses are extinct now, and to be cherished whenever found. Can we start a whisky extinction rebellion?\nTaste\nOld, soggy oak, slightly fatty body, some slight old style peatiness (think Littlemill or old Linkwood), and then that amazing fruitiness that's like the tastiest lemon sherbet. I'm getting some echoes of that 1967 25yo Chieftain's undisclosed Auchentoshan, although this has more gravitas and punch. Water doesn't IMO really change it, just makes it bigger, and bigger. It's very focused, not really veering anywhere from the main tastes, and displaying no flaws whatsoever.\nFinish\nLong on the sour old oak, with a wisp of drying peatiness in the tail. Lovely! Is Linlithgow/St. Magdalene the true queen of the Lowlands? I believe so."", 'Nice fruity spiciness, very fresh and powerful, really enjoyable', 'I agree with Lincolnimp, this is a great whisky.

Aged 30-years and bottled in 2003 it looks as if this is a 1973 vintage but I doubt:  In the early seventies the Brora distillery was simply named Clynelish too (internally) and the casks were stamped either Clynelish-A (for the modern Clynelish distillery) or Clynelish-B (for the old Brora distillery).  But in 1973 the processes did not work and either they just stamped all casks Clynelish only or they mingled the naming altogether - that is why Diageo decided to market all Clynelish/Brora casks from 1973 as Clynelish only (or have you ever come across a 1973 Brora?).  So I guess this bottling contains casks from 1972 (or earlier) because the Diageo managers are risk-avers in such matters, usually.  But I could not care less if the result is that excellent (and the 1972 vintage is believed to be the best of Brora, in general). \n\nPS:  Today I find the price I paid in 2005 very appropriate for a dram of this quality.\nNose\n95\n95\nThe colour is amber and the texture shows small sticky tears that consolidate to a fat sticky ring that moves downward simply as a ring (what a great oiliness). The nose offers an adorable peaty-fruity-honeyed Brora profile at its best, absolutely clean, complex and balanced.\nTaste\n93\n93\nThe taste is bold and unbelievable complex with all the flavours you wish to find in an old Brora. And it shows grace and dignity (if a taste can be that way). Many, many layers in there that just wait to be detected and enjoyed. Some water unlocks more aromas in the nose and flavours on the palate while keeping this amazing balance and elegance of the profile. I like it best when reduced to about 48% abv.\nFinish\n94\n94\nThe mouthfeel is just like the texture promised: great with an instantly warming coating of all parts of the mouth and no distracting moment whatsoever. This is excellent stuff, indeed! The finish is very long and even sweeter than the taste with nice nectar and spicy wooden notes (in addition to all what was in the taste already).', ""Great malt!

But before that it can be confirmed that the picture drawn in 1791 had done whisky distillation aside from farm management. Family run over 6 generations (temporary joint management, but it did not last long, owed a huge debt). Brendet had no priorities and thought that there was a future for single malt, and in 1969 the decision to remove from the blending malt of the Distillers Company (later Diazio) expanded the stock for single malt. In 1994, from the person in Illinois State, USA I visited the distillery and my father got a Glenfer class of one case in the 1930s, is there exactly the same but is it interesting? I get a letter with. As a result of the internal survey it was found that the case was the oldest existing, I returned from Illinois by securing a first class seat for that case.

Aromas of creamy cocoa and black pepper now whirl up the nose properly.\nTaste: Powerful 65% power, incomparably fat and creamy!

Nose: ah yes. It’s hard not to describe this baby just with ‘old Ardbeg’, it’s exactly the antithesis of any recent NAS Rollsancenovabeistdail. Despite the low strength, it’s actually much more aromatic and complex than most new versions, but also more dry, phenolic and empyreumatic. The first aroma that’s quite obvious in these old Arbbegs and that’s seldom to be found in new ones is camphor and even tiger balm, then soot, ashes and bonfire. Then more metal polish, graphite, cider apples, ‘old car engine’, high-end green tea… Anyway, this is simply beautiful. Mouth: good punch and a lot of salt in this one, all that on top of quite some leather and bitter chocolate. Does ‘the peacock’s tail’ after that, with some camphor, mint drops, orange blossom water, cured ham, liquorice, clams… and God knows what else. Like most of these 1963-1965 Ardbegs by G&M, it’s almost unbelievable that this was bottled at 40%. Probably more like 68%, rounded down to 40%. Just kidding. Finish: impressive, more on quince jelly and mint, always with this tar, this salt and this liquorice. Comments: extremely impressive, proof that you can have fabulous whisky that’s reduced to 40%, chill filtered and caramelised.

Much denser than in the nose, the sherry finish comes through nicely, but does not cover the bourbon barrel base in any way.
